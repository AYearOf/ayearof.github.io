# 2015 In Review
2015 was *A Year of Learning* with a strong focus on *learning music*.  
Learning to play an instrument was only half the battle. 

## Year-start Status
My knowledge of music theory was close to null. I knew how to play quite a few 
chords on the guitar (having played guitar and bass some 20 years ago), 
but I had no idea what a chord even was. I could barely read the notes 
of the treble clef and to top it off the system I learned those 20 years ago
was the solfege system, *Do-Re-Mi*, whereas most of the music and resources 
I had access to use the ??English *A-B-C* system.

I wanted to have a better understanding of it.

And learning I did. After having purchased off CraigsList an electric guitar, 
an [Epiphone Les Paul]()  towards the end of 2014,  
I have acquired a [Casio Privia PX-350]() digital piano with 88 weighted keys,
and proceeded to take piano lessons at [??location]().



## Year-end Status
- Can read music almost fluently - I can read-play one staff, but not grand
- Have a good understanding of theory fundamentals: scales, progressions, extended chords, cadences, roman system
- Decent understanding of modes (what they are but not quite how to use them proficiently)
- Composed a short classical piece
- Learned a few songs, can play piano with two hands
- Improved finger dexterity on guitar

## What Went Well?

- List of books
- List of classes
- List of online resources
- Took classes
- Apps 

## What Went Not-so-well?
- Lack of time for practice
- Lack of structure in practice
- Still not a great understanding of classic forms: sonata, counterpoint.
- Not doing very well with music analysis
- Hand coordination of piano is difficult when hands are playing at different speeds
- Initial fluency created higher expectations which ended up disappointing

## What Went Bad?
- Due to lack of practice, I lost momentum and thus lost interest. 
  Stopped playing piano in favor of guitar.
- Know of, but don't know the notes in extended chords.
- Not fluent beyond the major scale
- None of my other personal projects saw activity in 2015 

## Looking Forwad
- Continue to practice both piano and guitar (Might be able to practice alongside one of the kids)
- Should blog about the experience; other people might find it useful
- Should have more structure
- Explicit goals
- Should find a way to make it social (small group - e.g. jam together or bring a partner along)
- Lower expectations; need to space out activities more so that I don't become bored or distracted in the second half of the year
