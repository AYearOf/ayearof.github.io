# 2016 - A Year of Hobbies

In hindsight, deciding on what the next year will be midway through 2015
might have contributed a good deal of distraction and 
might have [derailed my efforts](#2015-review) more than I expected.

I was following behind the footsteps of my youngest step-daughter as 
we were trying to navigate the labyrinth at St. Thomas University.

In the moment, I thought it would be cool if I could build a robot
to navigate the labyrinth all by itself; and that gave birth to 
the idea that 2016 should be a year of hobbies, with emphasis on robots 
and perhaps AI. 


Robotics feels like a natural continuation to 2015, the [Year of Learning](#2015-review).  
It has physical elements, it has creative elements, and it has intellectual elements.
