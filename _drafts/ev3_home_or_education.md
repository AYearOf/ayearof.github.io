title: Mindstorms EV3: Home or Education?
---

Once I've settled on [using a robotics kit][roboticssets]
and have, wisely or not, [chosen the LEGO Mindstorms EV3][ev3vsiq],
I had to decide which kit to go with, because EV3 comes in 
two flavors:

- a **retail** version, known as [EV3 Home Edition][home] 
  or #31313 by its Lego ID, a [350 USD set][ev3amz], widely available, and
- an **education** version, called [EV3 Education Core][edu],
  item #45544 (more on this later), a [379 USD set][edu-us],
  available only from the [LEGO Education store][edu]
  (price and availability varies by geographic region).
