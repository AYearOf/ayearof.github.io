title: Mindstorms EV3: Home or Education?
---

Once I've settled on [using a robotics kit][roboticssets]
and have, wisely or not, [chosen the LEGO Mindstorms EV3][ev3vsiq],
I had to decide which kit to go with, because EV3 comes in 
two flavors:

- a **retail** version, known as [EV3 Home Edition][home] 
  or #31313 by its Lego ID, a [350 USD set][ev3amz], widely available, and
- an **education** version, called [EV3 Education Core][edu],
  item #45544 (also called #5003400), a [379 USD set][edu-us],
  available only from the [LEGO Education store][edu]
  (price and availability varies by geographic region).

While the kits have an large overlap in the number of pieces,
the robots you build with them are considerably different.

EV3 Education Core Robots:

To top it off, there's also an [Expansion set for the Education version][exp],
which allows even more robots to build.

## Choosing

I'm not going to go into great detail about how the sets compare.

[RobotSquare has a great article][rs-diff] going into exquisite 
detail on how the sets compare and how do they differ.   
Their article on [which set to buy][rs-which] has been 
a source of great inspiration in my choice too. 

After *very* careful consideration, I have decided to 
purchase the Education Core set and its Expansion set as well.  
Between the two of them one can build a significant number 
of very interesting robots.

However the robots from the Home set also look as if they are
a bundle of fun. This is when I decided I'd like to build them as 
well. 

Financially, it seems cheaper to purchase the Education Core set
then the pieces that differ between Education and Home then the other way
around. For one, that rechargeable battery that comes with the Core set
is both attractive and expensive.
