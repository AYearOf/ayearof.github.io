title: 2016 - A Year of Hobbies
---

In hindsight, deciding on what the next year was going to be midway 
through 2015 might have contributed a good deal of distraction and 
might have [derailed my efforts][2015-review] more than I expected.

It happened when I was following behind in the footsteps 
of my youngest step-daughter as we were trying 
to navigate the labyrinth at St. Thomas University.

In the moment, I thought how cool would it be if I could build a robot
to navigate the labyrinth all by itself. That was when I decided
that I will find a way to incorporate robotics, maybe even AI,
into my next year.

However, still smarting from the lessons "learned" during 
[2015 - The Year of Learning][2015-review],
I realized that I cannot and don't want to 
take on too much.
I needed to add some "fun" to my *Year Of...*

As such, 2016 will be a year of hobbies, 
hobbies that include playing video games, 
playing and listening to music, and 
maybe a bit of home improvement. 

Lack of time has caused a stack of video-games to accumulate
on top of my XBox. These include titles I was really looking 
forward to, such as Mass Effect, Assassin's Creed, and even 
going as far back as Fable 2 and Portal.
