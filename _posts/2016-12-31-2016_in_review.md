title: 2016 In Review
---

2016 was a *Year of Hobbies* with some emphasis on robotics.

## Success. Failure.

The year started with me purchasing a LEGO Mindstorms kit and with the help
of my daughter I even built a few robots. I don't know precisely what happened,
but all of a sudden it felt if not boring, at least dull.

Perhaps it was as soon as we built the claw robot and it worked well picking up
the object off one side, but had troubles securing it on the other side, and
it all started feeling like it debugging job and that's something I already do
too much in my main line of work.

I didn't like the programming environment much either. As a software developer,
it felt restricting rather than enabling and installing the Linux OS on it,
while empowering, moved the needle too much toward the *feels-like-work* side
of the specter.

Looking back, a [Scratch][scratch]-like or _Blockly_-like (used by [code.org][codeorg])
language would've served the Mindstorms much better.

It was an interesting experience and I am desperetaly wishing something
interesting comes my way again that will make me bring my Mindstorms
out of their boxes.

The year, to a large extent, it was also a **success**, seeing how I've listed video games
under *hobbies*. I've played a good amount of video games.

And then I encountered *Destiny* and my free time was done for.

Not all for naught, though:

* In the social space, *Destiny* increased my list of friends from roughly 3
   to **over 80**. A lot of these friends I hang out with even if we're playing different games.

* In the personal space, *Destiny* helped me build my patience and helped me work on
  my (in)ability to complete tasks/projects, including asking (bothering) friends
  for help;

* As the first console multi-player game I've played
  (how did I manage to get through 5 *HALO*s without ever playing PVP?!)
  it was both a satisfactory and a humbling experience. I'm old(er) and
  therefore my reflexes are slow, but the severe beatings I got in the *Crucible*,
  *Destiny* player-vs-player (PVP) arena definitely took my ego down a notch.

* Lastly, *Destiny* opened the door to programming *Slack* bots ([showoff][showoffbot] and [DestinyTracker][dtrbot])
  and allowed me to enjoy the wonderful community built around an incredible app: Ishtar Commander
  ([iOS](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/ishtar-commander-for-destiny/id1030835428?mt=8),
  [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.unintuitive.IshtarCommander&hl=en))

## Lessons Learned

*What worked* comes again from the world of video games.

Having bite-sized concrete tasks, i.e. quests, missions, and bounties, that are are trackable
and when appropriate measurable, helped keep me engaged. The satisfaction from completing
this tasks was large even from the smallest of them.

*What didn't work* came from the first half of the year where and when
I did a poor job of defining measurable tasks and even poorer job of tracking them.

That is by far the #1 tool I have to implement going into the new year: define and manage "deliverables".

## Carry-over

Video-games will definitely carry over into 2017. I want to keep playing - but
keeping it at a reasonable pace (maybe a few hours a week?) as it shouldn't
provide a distraction from the goals of 2017 or even normal life goals,
but it should be there as a relief valve, something my personal situation
has required quite often throughout 2016; however the lesson
of trackable, measurable goals should constantly remind me that
I need to continue applying them in fulfilling the goals of the new year
and even those of day-to-day life.

Furthemore, I will continue my engagement with the Slack-bot projects
mentioned above, and hopefully find novel way of either incorporating
my 2017 targets or perhaps would make for good resume padding buzzwords.

Finally, I'd also like to find a way to bring back Mindstorms into the mix,
but at the moment of writing this reflective post, I do not know
how to make that happen.

Here's to 2017 being better.
