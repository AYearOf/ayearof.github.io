## Week 1 - What Worked, What Didn't

**Worked**: having a plan.

This more or less made all the difference in the world.
Being able to know what I was supposed to be doing each day,
helped me track what I needed to pursue at each point.

Drawing while doing other activities (watching TV, meetings)
have helped increase the time I dedicated to practice,
although I haven't purposefully tracked these hours.

However, following the plan proved at times difficult,
mostly because *life* is Murphy's counterpart to planning.
Life events prevented me at least one day from sitting down and
practicing as by the time I had time I was also too tired
to mindfully practice.

Secondly, natural, physical limitations that I was unware of
when I planned have pushed back on the schedule. Due to hand
cramping, I found myself unable to continuously draw for an hour
at a time, let alone three as I had planned for the weekend.

Finally, I have struggled with some of the exercises,
in particular the rotating box, both in comprehension
and actual practice.


## Week 2 - Fewer Hours and Spaced Out Exercises

Instead of striving for an exact number, I'll strive for a range.

One hour per day Tuesday through Friday is excessive at this point
if done in a single setting. Instead *two half-hours* seem more
doable.

Three hours of practice on weekends are definitely out of the question,
so instead I'll shoot for the same one-hour.

That puts the *minimum* at 6 hours of weekly practice, not including
this review and planning as well and any other theoretical reading.

Exercises:

1. Focus primary on what I struggled with last week: rotating cubes.
  Continue practicing ellipses.
2. Allow for and introduce one simple decomposition exercise for each
  day.
3. For the weekend, work on Chapter 2, *Turning Edges into Objects*,
  and Chapter 3, *Adding Accuracty* from *Drawing for the Absolute and Utter Beginner* .
4. Read at least one more chapter of *Right-Side* and aim to also execute 
  its practice.
