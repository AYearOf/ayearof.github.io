title: Week 2 Review, Week 3 Planning

## Week 2 - Retrospective

Poor planning had me forget that last week overlapped
with Destiny's *Iron Banner* event. That meant most of my 
evenings had been unavailable to art :(

Longer hours at work due to delivery pressure meant my days
have also been unavailable. Looking back, it's almost a miracle
I managed to spend any time on it.

However, what little time I got to spend on perspective drawing
and on contour (lesson from "Drawing for the Absolute...")
on which I made good progress.


## Week 3 - Fewer Hours and Spaced Out Exercises

Will continue the same practice schedule laid out for week to.

Exercises:

1. Focus primary on what I struggled with last week: rotating cubes.
  Continue practicing ellipses.
2. Allow for and introduce one simple decomposition exercise for each
  day.
3. For the weekend, work on Chapter 2, *Turning Edges into Objects*,
  and Chapter 3, *Adding Accuracty* from *Drawing for the Absolute and Utter Beginner* .
4. Read at least one more chapter of *Right-Side* and aim to also execute 
  its practice.
