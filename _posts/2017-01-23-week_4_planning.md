## Week 3 - Much of the same

Unfortunately, week 3 saw much of the same lack of
practice that [Week 2](/week_3_planning) did.

In the beginning, it felt as if a good amount of personal
issue I had to deal with were impeding progress, but
as the week went on a certain lack of enthusiasm compounded
the issue. Looking back, I think it perhaps stems from a
certain amount of discouragement that came from trying,
and failing, a few perspective exercises, excersises
perhaps a bit too advanced at this point, and self-critique
perhaps a bit too harsh.

## Week 4 - Focus on fewer thing

A more regimented approach, with a focus on a single
book, *DAUB* in this case, combined with emphasis on
recognizing progress rather than being discouraged by
lack of skill will be the driving factor of Week 4.

I will also try to find a secondary source for learning
more about perspective drawing, seeing how the *DrawABox*
site was not as successful, for me, in helping me understand
how to be approach it.
