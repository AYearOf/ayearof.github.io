## Week 4 - Improvements

A good more deal of drawing happened in Week 4.

I noticed two things: one that I can practice the basics (lines, circles, ellipses)
while doing something else, mainly watching some TV; second, that I can
do small amounts of meaningful practice in small increments, 5 or 10 minutes
at a time while waiting on some other externalities: food to cook,
transportation to arrive, even waiting on some work email or event.

## Week 5 - Work in between the cracks

Carry-over from last week: trying to find a secondary source for learning
more about perspective drawing, seeing how the *DrawABox*
site was not as successful, for me, in helping me understand
how to be approach it.

Meanwhile, I will continue working with both the *DAUB* book
and with exercises, but I will try to favor doing those exercises
during small breaks rather than during my dedicated daily half-hour.
