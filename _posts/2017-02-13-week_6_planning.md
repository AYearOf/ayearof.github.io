## Week 5 - Interesting Reversal

Unlike previous weeks, week numero cinque saw a good deal more
practice during the week and almost none during the weekend.

Working in small increments... worked. I was able to practice
lines, circles, elipses in there small windows of free time.

Furthermore, I've made some great progress on perspective drawing,
in particular circles/elipses and objects in general. I guess
that's one reason to be thankful for meetings.

I've also managed to finish the [R2D2 Metal Earth model](http://www.fascinations.com/metalearth/star-wars/r2d2),
which would fall more hobby than art, but it was hard work to
get it done anyway.

## Week 6 - Continue Working in between the Cracks

It's been six weeks since I've started, as evidenced by my need to
renew *DAUB* and *RightSide*. Not quite the progress I've expected.

I need to find a way to (re-?) double my efforts and try to push,
more so on weekends, through the *DAUB* book. I think I'm now
getting to some interesting parts, so the excitement should carry
me through these periods of lul.
