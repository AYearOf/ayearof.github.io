## Week 6 - Longer Projects

While the amount of time spent on drawing has been about the same or even
increased, I've also noticed that specifically setting time aside has
resulted in slightly larger projects being undertaken, with
generic excercises taking a bit of a backseat.

With such larger projects, I was able to see an increase in my ability to
deal with perspective and observed proportions, something I have just
started to get into.

Where I seem to faulter is observational skills: for example where
lines from a section align with lines from a different, remote section.  
This is another area I've noticed an improvement: I am now planning
my drawing a bit better, observing where such continuity exists.

## Week 7 - Shading; Reintroducing Exercises

While longer projects is an encouraging trend,
after all time spent drawing is never wasted,
I'd like to reintroduce generic exercises, in particular the boxes-in-perspective
of DrawABox.

Second area of mindful practice is *line continuity* and I will
attempt to practice this in combination with *proportions*. For these
exercises I will attempt to find moderately complex instalations of simple shapes
and, without focusing on details, attempt to capture their relative proportions
and notice where pseudo-continuities exist.

Finally, the next chapter in *DAUB* deals with shading, so it should
be easy to incorporate those exercises into my daily practice.
