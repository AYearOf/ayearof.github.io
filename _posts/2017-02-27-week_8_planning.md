## Week 7 - Progress, but Spotty Availability

I liked the progress I made this week; I definitely notice both the increased
awareness in examining subjects, sometimes catching mistakes before I even
made them (are they still mistakes in that case?)

However, throughout the week my availability has been spotty.  
Then during the weekend I completely dropped the ball.

This seems to be occurring with some frequency, but I am not ready to make a
decision about how to handle it.

## Week 7 - Shading; Reintroducing Exercises

Last week I have watched an interesting video in the
[Draw with Jazza] series on [how to practice][practice].

It breaks down drawing practice into several different areas and I intend to
incorporate them into my routine as following:

- Tuesday - *tutorial marathon*: this will consist on going through as many
  of the *DAUB* chapters as I can in half an hour, both reading and practice,
  and this will set the theme for the week, in other words I'll keep repeating
  during whatever windows of time I can find whatever I have managed to cover
  in that half an hour;
- Wednesday - *deconstruction of photos*: take photos from the internet or
  scenes from video games (building into my hobby from last year) and attempt
  to break them down into simple geometric forms and/or outlines;
- Thursday - *life drawing*: draw objects from my surroundings trying to
  transform their 3D nature into 2D, incorporating lessons from the past such
  as perspectice and shading;
- Friday - *reduce time repetition*: I will select a photo or an object and
  attempt to draw it in a certain amount of time, for example in 20 minutes;
  I will then reset and attempt to draw it in 15, 10, 5, then finally 2 minutes.
  This will teach me about discovering what is essential in a subject;
- Saturday - *focus on what's hard*, focus on what I seem to have troubles with
  or what I seem to be avoiding, most likely it will be some human feature,
  and luckily *Draw with Jazza* has some great tutorials on it, or perhaps
  it'll finally be the day I address the box-sphere exercise of *DrawABox*;
- and finally *Sunday* I will attempt to *product a complete drawing*
  incorporating all the lessons of the week.
