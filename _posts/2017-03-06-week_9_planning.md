## Week 8 - Progress *Despite* Spotty Availability

The strategy to focus on specific areas from [Week 8 Planning](/2017/week_8_planning)
bore fruits. Except for two items, *reduced time repetition* and
*focus on what's hard*, I managed to hit the others quite well.

So this week I'll continue with the same approach.

## Week 9 - Shading; Reintroducing Exercises

This is mostly a re-hash of last week's plan:

- Tuesday - *tutorial marathon* with *DAUB*
- Wednesday - *deconstruction of photos*;
- Thursday - *life drawing*;
- Friday - *reduce time repetition*;
- Saturday - *focus on what's hard*: will attempt to work on drawing
  human features;
- and finally *Sunday* - *product a complete drawing*.
