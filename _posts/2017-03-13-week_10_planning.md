## Week 9 - Practiceless Weekends

I liked the strategy laid in [Week 8 Planning](/2017/week_8_planning)
and then again in Week 9, but for some reason I seemed to have lost
wind as I got closer to the weekend, leading to a weekend with
almost no practice.

And no matter how much I tried reminding myself to draw,
I didn't seem to muster the enthusiasm for it.

## Week 10 - Changing Gears

The plan was pretty solid, but this week I want to try something
different.

I borrowed a book on drawing [Kawaii] characters,

[![Manga for the Beginner Kawaii](https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51nOK0c3wTL.jpg)][book]

and I intend to spend each day covering at least a chapter, as following:

* Tuesday: *Cute Proportions*, *Drawing the Head*, and *Eye Types*;
* Wednesday: *Silly Expressions*;
* Thursday: *The Full Figure* and *Positioning Your Character at Different Angles*;
* Friday: *Color Variations* and *Beginner vs. Pro: Girl With Teddy Bear*;
* Saturday: *Beginner vs. Pro*, rest of figures;
* Sunday: free drawing - try to come up with some characters of my own.

It's a bit of a departure, but it should give me a minor
boost since [novelty tends to improve productivity][novelty].

We'll see next week how well it worked.
