## Week 10 - Faster in the Beginning

This may have been my most successful week to date
as I managed to complete almost everything I had set up for myself.

The only item left out was Sunday's free drawing, which I had
replaced with drawing a structure while out at the dog park.

However, most of the progress was made early in the week,
with Friday and Saturday seeing almost no practice,
mainly due to chores and other tasks that took up time.

## Week 11 - Same Path, but Less

Considering *Mass Effect: Andromeda* is being released this week,
I expect to spend some time gaming and less time drawing.

However, inspired by the success of the previous week,
I will continue pursuing the *kawaii* path as following:

* Tuesday: *Beginner vs. Pro - Sad Bunny, Basket of Pups and Friends*;
* Wednesday: *Essential Kawaii Types: Cute Girls*, *Cat Girls and Anthros*;
* Thursday:  *Animal Cuties*, *Fantasy Creatures and Pets*;
* Friday: *Food and Treats with Personality*, *Gothic Cuties*;
* Saturday : *Adorable Anthros: Hamster Boy* and *Hamster Girl*;
* Sunday:  *Tiger Boy* and *Tiger Girl*;

This should allow me to move forward, while still
maintaining a non-overwhelming schedule.
