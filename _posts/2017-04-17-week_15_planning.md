title: Week 15 Planning

## Review of Weeks 11 - 14

On March 21st, [Mass Effect: Andromeda](https://www.masseffect.com) was released.

A week later, March 28th, [Destiny's Age of Triumph][AoT] dropped.

In my [planning for Week 11](/2017/week_11_planning) I was harboring
an illusion (delusion?) that I'd get anything done, as little as it was.

Well, turns out that *ME: A* was glorious and *AoT* and the new raids
have eaten into my time like nothing else.

It feels as if my every awake hour has been spent either working or
playing and it was absolutely phenomenal. Even as I write this, I ache
that I'm not in front of my Xbox playing either of the two.

## Week 15 - Back on the Horse (... Pony)

That being said, I have managed to complete my *Age of Triumph Record Book*,
and ordered my [Age of Triumph T-shirt][AOTShirt], and although I have not yet
finished *ME: A*, I expect to be able to allocate some of my time towards
drawing.

I intend to focus on developing my kawaii characters by going beyond outline
drawing and adding some coloring.

* Tuesday: *Gothic Cuties*;
* Wednesday: *Adorable Anthros: Hamster Boy* and *Hamster Girl*;
* Thursday: *Tiger Boy* and *Tiger Girl*;
* Friday: *Wolf Boy* and *Wofl Girl*;
* Saturday: *Panda Tyke* and *Humorous Panda*;
* Sunday: catching up on anything I dropped during the week.
