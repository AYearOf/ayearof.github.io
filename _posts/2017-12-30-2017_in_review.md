title: 2017 In Review
---

Turns out I faltered again not even midway through.
There was a combination of factors thad decreased the amount of time available
and when I found myself without a job you’d think
that all of a sudden more time could be dedicated to this endeavor.
And yet…

My hypothesis is that I keep picking interests
that are at the intersection of interesting (what gets them picked)
and difficult (what creates frustration)
and not immediately impactful on my life (what kills the drive).

I’m keeping my art supplies though. I’d like to try again some day.

So there you go, another year of failures.

The only thing that was successful was the sabbatical
that confirmed I am ready to retire.

So very ready…
