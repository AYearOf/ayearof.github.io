title: Breakfast No. 1 - Frittata
---

This is more to prove my lack of skills,
but here's breakfast #1: a frittata with potatoes

I wish that:

1. I had captured a better photo of the top -
  it was more appealing;
2. I had the presence of mind to save a link to the recipe.

Frittata's are a good alternative to scrambled eggs,
even though it's a bit more complicated to make.
However, the baking of the mix gives it a nice crust on the top,
the vigurous beating of the eggs makes it fluffier,
and the mixing of ingredients imparts more flavor throughout.

I think I'll try to make this in the future.
