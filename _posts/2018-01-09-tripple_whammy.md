title: First Two Weeks - Middle East and Africa
---

To be honest I really wanted to start of with Thai food.

But Christmas has not been kind to our waistlines
and there's a few cuisines around the world I absolutely cannot
resist. Thai, Indian, and Italian are out for that reason.

Following the organization of 
[Cooking Light Global Kitchen: The World's Most Delicious Food Made Easy](https://www.amazon.com/dp/0848739981/ref=cm_sw_r_cp_api_rVDBAbKBFPNH3)
I have selected **Middle East and Africa** as the topic of the first
two-week cycle.

The first dish: a double and a bit ambitious, is
**Chicken Tabbouleh with a Tahini Drizzle**  and
**Batrik** - a Turkish salad of bulgur and walnuts.

Notes:

* The Tabbouleh ended up a bit dry - I think the bulgur
  soaks up everything well; the Tahini Sauce didn't help much -
  add too much and it all tastes like tahini, add too little
  and the grains dry it all out;
* I ended up burning the chicken and surpringly that burned
  chicken ended up stealing the show - it was really good, no doubt;
* I liked the Batrik although I feel I used a bit too much sauce
  -- a tomato based sauce -- and it drenched the whole dish.
  The texture was amazing and I look forward to making this again.

For breakfast I made scrambled eggs with the remaining chicken,
carrots, peas, and onions. The difference from past attempts
was incorporating some milk into the eggs which made them fluffier.

I liked the texture of the carrots, but I feel between their sweetness
and that of the caramelized onion it all ended up being a bit too much.

Nothing Sriracha cannot fix.
