title: Mesir Wat - Spicy Red Lentil Stew
---

**Mesir Wat** is a dish hailing from Ethiopia. *Wat* is a stew of curry and
there are several variations, some which include meats (*Doro Wat* has chicken).

What they all have in common is the
[*Berbere* spice mix](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berbere),
which typically includes chili peppers, garlic, ginger, coriander, fenugreek,
and allspice and which is a key ingredient in the cuisines of not just
Ethiopia but Eritrea as well.

The version I used is Frontier's [Berbere Seasoning](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B005WDVQHG/).

My *Wat* is vegetarian - **Mesir Wat**, with lentils, and it was *absolutely delicious*.

Notes:

* Definitely a remake, although I would love to make my own version of the
  *Berbere* mix; I felt the *Frontier's* version, though it may be authentic,
  was too spicy - I would like more of the other flavors in the mix
  to come through.
