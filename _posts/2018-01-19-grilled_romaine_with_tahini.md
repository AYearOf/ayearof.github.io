title: Grilled Romaine with Tahini Drizzle
---

Proof that when I deviate from the recipe I come up with crappy results.

The original recipe from
[The Whole 30 Cookbook](https://www.amazon.com/Whole30-Cookbook-Delicious-Totally-Compliant/dp/0544854411/)
calls for halves of Romaine lettuce to be grilled on a ...grill.

I took the easy way out and grilled them in a pan on the stove top.
Also didn't grill halves but already chopped.

As a result the flavor was there but texture wise it was a flop - literally.

The spicy tahini was pretty spot on with this lettuce -
the charred flavored came through and didn't get drowned.

As a further deviation, I used walnuts instead of the sliced
almonds the recipe called for because I had them left over
from the [bulgur salad](/triple_whammy.html). I'm sure someone
with a better palate would be able to tell the difference
but to me it was about the hard texture of the nuts
and walnuts, almonds - they're all the same.

Theme-wise, I feel the tahini allows this recipe to fall
in the *Middle East and Africa* theme, although I'm not really
sure there's an actual dish made in the area.

Might do again - maybe when I'm grilling something else.
