title: Pasta Saltata - Red Whole-Wheat Penne
---

> According to chef Marcus Samuelson,
  "A brief Italian occupation from 1936 to 1941
  left a European presence evident in Ethiopia's cathedrals
  and in dishes like pasta saltata."

Those are the notes on
[Cooking Light Global Kitchen: The World's Most Delicious Food Made Easy](https://www.amazon.com/dp/0848739981/ref=cm_sw_r_cp_api_rVDBAbKBFPNH3)
recipe for *Red Whole-Wheat Penne* aka *Pasta Saltata* another
dish of Ethiopian inspiration.

Despite following the instructions,
the dish ended up with too much [Harissa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harissa)-based sauce,
and thus the picture is messy and doesn't do justice
to the dish.

I tend to avoid mixing starches, but having both potatoes
and pasta imparts an incredible texture to the dish.


Given Ethiopia has it's own mix, the [Berbera](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berbere) --
so well featured in the [Mesir Wat](/mesir_wat.html) --
I also found the presence of Harissa in this dish a bit surprising.

Harissa is typical of the North African region - in particular
Tunisia where is considered the "national condiment" and of which
Tunisia is also the largest exporter (some 22,000 tonnes in 2016).

Notes:

* add less sauce next time (but it was so good!).
* learn more about the spices of the region
  where the dish hails from.

Definitely a remake.
