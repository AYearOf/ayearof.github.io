title: Cycle 2 - Europe - Patatas Bravas
---

For the second two-week cycle I have picked the European region
and the first dish comes from Spain: **Patatas Bravas** or
**Fierced Potatoes**.

The hands-on time is short at only 20 minutes, but it takes
a few hours between soaking potatoes for 2 hours in ice-cold water
and baking them in the oven for some 45 minutes.

I think I messed something in the recipe because it didn't come out spicy
at all. As a matter of fact some of the tasters complained that the sauce
was too sweet.

The recipe calls for ground red pepper and not having those I used
cayenne powder, which in my mind should've make it even spicier.

I liked them - the rest of my tribe not so much.

Shown here with chicken because it felt as if it needed some protein.

I might try it again and maybe up the dosage on all the spicy stuff?

## Recipe

Hands-on time: 20 min; Total time: 3 hr 30 min.

Ingredients:

* 2 pounds baking potatoes
* 3 tablespoons olive oil, divided
* 1/4 teaspoon saffron threads, finely crushed
* 3/4 teaspoon salt, divided
* 1/2 cup chopped yellow onion
* 2 large garlic cloves, minced
* 1 bay leaf
* 2 bottled roasted piquillo peppers 
  or 1 bottled roasted red bell pepper,
  drained and chopped (1/2 cup)
* 1.5 cups unsalted tomato puree (fresh or canned)
* 1 tablespoon Spanish smoked paprika
* 1/4 teaspoon ground red pepper
* 1 tablespoon sherry vinegar
* 2 tablespoons chopped fresh chives

Preparation:

1. Soak whole potatoes in ice water in refrigerator 2 hours; drain.
   Cut potatoes into 1-inch cubes.  
   Steam potatoes, covered, 9 minutes or until just tender.  
   Rinse with cold water; drain and pat dry;
2. Preheat oven to 450F;
3. Combine 1.5 tablespoons olive oil and saffron in the center
   of a jelly-roll pan (*I used a tin-foil wrapped regular baking pan*).  
   Bake at 450F for 3 to 4 minutes to bloom saffron.  
   Scrape oil and saffron into a medium bowl using a rubber spatula.  
   Return pan to oven. Add potatoes and 1/3 teaspoon salt to saffron oil,
   tossing to coat.
4. Spread potatoes on preheated pan;
   bake at 450F for 45 minutes or until golden brown and crisp,
   stirring twice.
5. While potatoes cook, heat a small saucepan over medium heat.  
   Add remaining 1.5 tablespoons oil to pan; swirl to coat.  
   Add onion; sauté 4 minutes or until tender.  
   Add garlic and bay leaf; sauté 1 minute.  
   Add roasted pepper, tomato puree, paprika, and ground red pepper;
   bring to a boil over high heat.  
   Reduce heat to low; cover and simmer 20 minutes, stirring occasionally.
6. Remove from heat; discard bay leaf.  
   (*I didn't do these blending steps - it was smooth enough from cooking).
   Place pepper mixture, remaining 1/4 tea- spoon salt, and vinegar in a blender.  
   Remove center piece of blender lid (to allow steam to escape);
   secure blender lid on blender.  
   Place a clean towel over opening in blender lid (to avoid splatters).  
   Blend until smooth.  
   Spoon sauce on o plates or a platter.  
   Top with potatoes, and sprinkle with chives.  
   Serves 8 (serving size: 2/3 cup potatoes and 1/4 cup sauce)
