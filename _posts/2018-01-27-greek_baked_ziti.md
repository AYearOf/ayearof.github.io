title: Greek Baked Ziti
---

This is a lighter version of a classic Italian dish.

Houston hosts annually [The Original Greek Festival](http://greekfestival.org/)
and one of the dishes they make and we love is the Greek lasagna.  
I'm happy this recipe makes the Ziti taste exactly like that.

I don't know if that's what makes it Greek, but the addition of cinnamon
completely alters its taste profile. The meat cooked in tomato sauce
helps with that too.

The recipe calls for lamb, a meat I'm not a huge fan off, but I have to say
the lamb taste does not come strong, if at all, in this dish.

The picture below doesn't do the dish justice; I however wanted to show
the layering of the pasta - the red sauce with meat *and* pasta at the bottom
and the white-sauce pasta up on top.

Definitely a remake.
