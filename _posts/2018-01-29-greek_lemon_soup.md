title: Greek Lemon Soup
---

For the second week of the cycle
I decided to try my hand at a couple of soups.

*Joy of Cooking* is of course a great resource for soups.

The first is an intriguing, yet easy to make,
*Greek Lemon Soup* ðŸ˜². It's basically chicken soup
with rice mixed in with eggs to give it a smooth texture
and with a generous dose of lemon juice.

My peoples are not big on soups, but I loved this and
I'm looking to make it again, maybe in the summer - the lemon
makes it very refreshing.

## Recipe

Makes about 4 cups.
Hands-on time: 5-10 minutes, Total time: 25-30 minutes.

Ingredients:

* 3 cups chicken stock of broth
* 1/2 cups of long-grain rice
* 2 large eggs
* 1/4 cup fresh lemon juice
* 1/4 cup fresh lemon juice for seasoning (optional)
* 1/4 cup chopped fresh parsley or dill for seasoning (optional)

Unlike *stracciatella*, where the eggs are supposed to
separate, here the eggs are blended to create a smooth,
creamy texture. This is done by adding a little of the
hot stock to the eggs before they are added to the soup
to prevent them from curdling.

Bring to a rolling boil in a medium saucepan,:

* 3 cups chicken stock (or chicken broth)
* 1/2 cup long-grain rice

Reduce the heat, cover, and simmer until the rice is
tender, about 20 minutes.

In a medium bowl, whisk just enough to combine and be uniform in color:

* 2 large eggs
* 1/4 cup fresh lemon juice

Stir 2 tablespoons of the hot stock into the egg mixture.

To prevent curdling, *gradually* pour the egg mixture into
*the hot, not boiling, soup while stirring
constantly. Season with:

* 1 to 2 tablespoons fresh lemon juice (optional)

Salt and ground black pepper to taste.

Ladle into warmed bowls.  
Garnish with chopped fresh parsley or snipped fresh dill.
