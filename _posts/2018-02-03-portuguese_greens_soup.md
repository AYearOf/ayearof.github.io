title: Portuguese Greens Soup (Caldo Verde)
---

I tend to have distaste for boiled vegetables;
I also like a challenge and part of the challenge of this
*Year of Cooking* is not only to learn new recipes
but to expand my horizons. Although I will continue
to stay away from fish (yuk).

> This hearty soup is from the province of Minho, Portugal,
which is famous for its cooking. *Caldo verde* was
brought to us by the Portuguese communities in Cape
Cod, Rhode Island, and other parts of the eastern
seaboard.

It has boiled kale. This should be interesting.

## Recipe

Make about 10 cups. It's not light on hands-on time: I'd say
maybe about 20 minutes, but you also have to supervise the soup
while boiling; a total cooking time of about 40 minutes.

### Ingredients

* 1 tablespoon olive oil;
* 1 medium onion, chopped;
* 2 cloves garlic, minced;
* 2 cups chicken stock;
* 4 medium potatoes;
* 1 1/2 teaspoon salt;
* 1/2 teaspoon ground pepper;
* 6 ounces Portuguese *linguiga* or chorizo sausage, thinly sliced;
* 4 cups shredded kale, Swiss chard, or collard leaves (*6-8 ounces*)
* 2 tablespoons lemon juice

### Preparation

Heat in a large soup pot, over medium-low heat:

* lh tablespoons olive or other vegetable oil

Add and cook, stirring, until tender but not browned, **5 to 10 minutes**:

* 1 medium onion, chopped
* 2 cloves garlic, minced

Stir in:

* 8 cups water, or 6 cups water and 2 cups Chicken Stock
* 4 medium potatoes, peeled and thinly sliced
* 1 1/2 teaspoons salt
* 1/2 teaspoon ground black pepper

Bring to a boil, reduce the heat, and simmer until the
potatoes are soft, about **20 minutes**.  
Remove the pot from the heat.

Using a potato masher, lightly mash the potatoes right in the pot.
(This will give the soup a chunky texture.)

Heat in a medium skillet, over medium-high heat:

* 1 teaspoon vegetable oil (optional)

Add and cook, stirring, until browned:

* 6 ounces Portuguese linguiga or chorizo sausage, thinly sliced

Add to the soup pot.  

Pour 1 cup of the soup into the skillet.  
Scrape up the browned bits and return the liquid and browned bits to the soup.  
Simmer for **5 minutes**.

Stir in:

* 4 cups shredded kale, Swiss chard, or collard leaves

Simmer for **5 minutes**. Stir in:

* 2 tablespoons fresh lemon juice

Ladle into warmed bowls

**Notes**:

1. I don't even know where I'd find *linguiga*; chorizo it is;
2. I don't know how to cook things in oil without it splashing all over the over;
   The chorizo here was no different.
3. The kale doesn't soften enough to be gross - it stays somewhat firm
   so my concerns have been averted.

Possible remake.
