A little out of band because this technically falls under
*Middle-East and Africa* cycle, but I had some left-over ground lamb
from the [Greek Baked Ziti](/greek_baked_ziti.html)
and this recipe looked simple.

## Recipe

Serves about 4. Takes about 20-30 minutes to prepare

### Ingredients

* 1 (31/2-ounce) bag boil-in-bag jasmine rice
* 1 teaspoon saffron threads
* 2 tablespoons thinly sliced green onions
* 2 tablespoons minced fresh cilantro
* 2 tablespoons grated fresh onion
* 2 tablespoons 2% Greek-style plain yogurt
* 1 teaspoon ground cumin
* 1 teaspoon ground coriander
* 1 teaspoon turmeric
* 2 teaspoons bottled minced garlic
* 1/2 teaspoon salt
* 1/4 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper
* 1 pound lean ground lamb
* Cooking spray
* 1/2 cup 2% Greek-style plain yogurt
* 1/4 cup chopped bottled roasted red bell pepper
* 1 teaspoon ground cumin
* I teaspoon ground coriander
* 2 teaspoons bottled minced garlic
* 1/2 teaspoon crushed red pepper
* 1/4 teaspoon salt

### Preparation

1. Cook boil-in-bag jasmine rice and saffron in boiling water according to package directions.
  Drain; fluff rice with a fork. Sprinkle with green onions.
2. While rice cooks, combine cilantro and next 9 ingredients (through lamb);
   shape into 12 oblong patties (*use a little less than a quarter cup of the mix for each patty*).
3. Heat a large nonstick skillet over medium-high heat.
  Coat pan with cooking spray.
  Add patties to pan; cook **10 minutes** or until done, turning occasionally to brown on all sides.
4. While kofta cooks, combine 1/2 cup yogurt and remaining ingredients. (*or use Harissa mix*)

Serve sauce with kofta and rice. Serves 4 (serving size: 3 patties, about 1/4 cup sauce, and about 1/3 cup rice)

## Notes

1. I didn't use all lamb. I mixed half a pound of ground lamb
   and half a pound of ground beef;
   I don't know if that had any effect on the final result.
2. I still am trying to master cooking meat.
   I was so afraid of it being uncooked, that I think
   I cooked it too much. The patties ended up dry - very dry.
   I'm not sure I know how to best gauge when they're done,
   but it didn't feel as if the *10 minutes* mentioned
   in the recipe were enough.
3. You could and definitely *should* make the sauce with
   the ingredients they specify.
   Or you could do what I did and use
   [pre-made Harissa mix](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B005WDVR0W/).

It wasn't a huge hit with the family even if they were hungry
that night.
