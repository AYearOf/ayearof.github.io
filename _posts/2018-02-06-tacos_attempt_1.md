title: Tacos - Attempt 1
---

This is my first attempt at tacos. Not the most successful meal I made,
but it's something I'm determined to nail.

Instead of the typical ground beef, I used ground turkey not because it was
healthier but because that's what I had on hand.

For spice mix, I used [Alton Brown's Taco Potion #19](https://altonbrown.com/taco-potion-19-recipe/).

For preparation I used [Culinary Hill's The Best Turkey Tacos](https://www.culinaryhill.com/saucy-turkey-tacos/) -
which calls for 1 cup of tomato juice.

That latter part is important because I think it's what went wrong that
made the recipe taste more like Sloppy Joes than regular tacos.

As a test, I changed the Taco Potion #19 recipe to replace the cumin
with garam masala. That yielded some delicious mix.
