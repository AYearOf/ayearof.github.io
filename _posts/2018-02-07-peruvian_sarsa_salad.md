title: Peruvian Sarsa Salad
---

This is one of the more surprising salads I had. It's full of fiber, filling and the lemon juice makes it always feel fresh.

> A common condiment in Peru sara is a salsa or relish of chopped fresh
> onions, herbs, and citrus juice. Some versions include tomatoes.
> Some toss in radishes.
> As long as the the base of the relish remains crisp and puckery,
> you can add what you like.
> This version from chef Douglas Rodriguez is a fuller salad
> including lima beans hominy and Farmer's cheese.
