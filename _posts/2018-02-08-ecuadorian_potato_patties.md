title: Ecuadorian Potato and Cheese Patties (Llapingachos Ecuatorianos)
---

An easy to make meal, these potatoes patties are quite delicious.

After making it I see it as a basic for continuous improvements and
I already have a couple of these "improvements" in mind:

* adding crumbled bacon
* using both regular and purple potatoes in the making
* adding various spices (curry?! OMG!!)
* adding other vegetables - maybe zucchini?

## Recipe

Serves 6 (*barely 4 if you have other things on the table*).

Supposedly takes about 20 minutes on hands-on time, total 65.

It took me about 30 - these numbers must come from either skilled chefs or
somebody who's done all the cutting and measuring before hand. I think mashing
the potatoes alone took me 10 minutes.

### Ingredients

* 1 3/4 teaspoons kosher salt, divided
* 2 medium baking potatoes (about 11/4 pounds), peeled and quartered
* 11/2 ounces shredded queso fresco or Monterey Jack cheese (about 6 tablespoons)
* 2 tablespoons minced green onions
* 1/4 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper
* 1 tablespoon olive oil
* 3/4 cup diced tomato
* 1/2 cup julienne-cut red onion

### Preparation

1. Place 1 1/2 teaspoons salt and potatoes in a saucepan, and cover with water.  
   Bring to a boil; reduce heat, and simmer **15 minutes** or until tender.  
   Drain, and mash with a potato masher until smooth.  
   Cool.
2. Add cheese, green onions, remaining 1/4 teaspoon salt,
   and pepper to potato mixture, stirring well.  
   Divide potato mixture into 6 balls (about 1/2 cup per ball).  
   Flatten balls into h-inch-thick patties (about 3-inch diameter).  
   Place on a baking sheet; cover and refrigerate 20 minutes or until firm.
3. Heat large nonstick skillet over medium heat.  
   Add oil to pan; swirl to coat.  
   Place patties in pan; cook **5 minutes** or until bottoms are browned.  
   Turn patties; cook 3 minutes.  
4. Top patties with tomato and red onion.  

Serves 6 (serving size: 1 patty, 2 tablespoons tomato, and 4 teaspoons red onion)
