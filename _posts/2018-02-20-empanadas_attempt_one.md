title: Baked Empanadas - Attempt Number One
---

An empanada is a fried (more delicious) or baked (healthier?) bread of pastry stuffed with a savoury filling.

In one shape or another, they are present all over the work:

* In India they are called [samosas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samosa);
* In Bangladesh they're called *shingara*;
* Maldivians call them *bajiyaa*;
* In Indonesia they are known as *pastel* and *pasteis* in Brazil;
* They are called *sambusak* in Israel;
* *chamu√ßas* in Portugal and in the Goa province of India;
* *samboosa* throughout the Horn of Africa and towards the southern side.

I'd argue that the Italian [*calzone*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calzone)
and even the Greek [*spanakopita*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spanakopita)
are in the same family, if not quite the same.

My recipe, from [Cooking Light Global Kitchen: The World's Most Delicious Food Made Easy](https://www.amazon.com/dp/0848739981/ref=cm_sw_r_cp_api_rVDBAbKBFPNH3)
of course, called for sweet potatoes and black beans empanadas,
but I soon found with a rebellion on my hands as the tribe demanded
meat and some of the members didn't like sweet potatoes.

What we ended up with is half the empanadas half-filled with *regular* potato and beans
and half with the planned sweet potato and beans.

It was a lot of work.

## Recipe

This is not an easy to make recipe. It takes quite a lot in preparation,
which is almost continuous throughout the making of it.

I cannot even imagine what the fried ones are like.

### Ingredients

* 9 ounces all-purpose flour (about 2 cups)
* 3/4 teaspoon kosher salt
* 1/3 cup canola oil
* 1/4 cup cold water
* 1 tablespoon cider vinegar
* 1 large egg, lightly beaten
* 1 poblano Chile
* 1 tablespoon cumin seeds
* 1 cup mashed cooked sweet potatoes
* 1 cup canned black beans, rinsed and drained
* 1/3 cup chopped green onions
* 2 tablespoons chopped fresh cilantro
* 1 teaspoon ancho Chile powder
* 1/2 teaspoon kosher salt
* 1 egg white, lightly beaten
* Cooking spray

### Preparation

1. Weigh or lightly spoon flour into dry measuring cups, and level with a knife.  
   Combine flour and 3/4 teaspoon salt in a large bowl, stirring with a whisk.  
   Combine canola oil, 1/4 cup cold water, vinegar, and egg in a medium bowl.  
   Gradually add oil mixture to flour mixture, stirring just until moist.  
   Knead lightly until smooth.  
   Shape dough into a ball, and wrap in plastic wrap. Chill **1 hour**.
2. Preheat broiler.  
   Place Chile on a foil-lined baking sheet;  
   broil 8 minutes or until blackened, turning after **6 minutes**.  
   Place in a paper bag; close tightly.  
   Let stand **15 minutes**.  
   Peel Chile; cut in half lengthwise.  
   Discard seeds and membranes; finely chop.
3. Preheat oven to 400F (*I would do this in step 4 - the following took me quite a while*).  
   Cook cumin seeds in a large saucepan over medium heat **1 minute** or until toasted, stirring constantly.  
   Place cumin in a clean spice grinder; process until ground.  
   Combine cumin, poblano, sweet potatoes, and next 5 ingredients (through 1/2 teaspoon salt) in a large bowl;  
   mash with a fork until almost smooth.
4. Divide dough into 10 equal portions, shaping each into a ball.  
   Roll each dough portion into a 5-inch circle on a lightly floured surface.  
   Working with 1 portion at a time (cover remaining dough to keep from drying),
   spoon 3 tablespoons poblano mixture into center of each circle.  
   Moisten edges of dough with egg white; fold dough over filling.  
   Press edges together to seal.  
   Place on a large baking sheet coated with cooking spray.  
   Cut 3 diagonal slits across top of each empanada.  
   Bake at 400F for **16 minutes** or until lightly browned.

Serves 10 (serving size: 1 empanada). *Good luck eating only one!*
