title: Kung Pao Taco

The following recipe is proof that you can wrap anything in a tortilla
and it becomes a taco.

To be honest, I think I would prefer this recipe over rice; it is however
an intriguing meal.

## Recipe

Takes about an hour due to marination of the chicken.

### Ingredients

* 6 skinless, boneless chicken thighs, cut into bite-sized pieces
  (*use chicken breasts, they're easier to work with*)
* 3 tablespoons lower-sodium soy sauce, divided
* 1/4 cup plus 1 1/2 teaspoons cornstarch, divided
* 1/4 teaspoon kosher salt
* 2 tablespoons canola oil, divided
* 1 1/2 tablespoons honey
* 1 tablespoon dark sesame oil
* 2 teaspoons rice vinegar
* 1 teaspoon sambal oelek (ground fresh Chile paste) (*substitute sriracha if not available*)
* 1 large garlic clove, minced
* 3 tablespoons coarsely chopped dry-roasted peanuts
* 3/4 cup diagonally sliced celery (about 2 stalks)
* 8 (6-inch) corn tortillas
* 1/3 cup sliced green onions
* 1/2 medium red bell pepper thinly sliced
* 4 lime wedges

### Preparation

1. Place chicken in a large zip-top plastic bag.  
  Add 1 tablespoon soy sauce to bag; seal.  
  Marinate at room temperature **30 minutes**.  
  Remove chicken from bag; discard marinade.  
  Place 1/4 cup cornstarch in a shallow dish.  
  Sprinkle chicken evenly with salt.  
  Add chicken to cornstarch in dish, and toss chicken to thoroughly coat.  
  Shake off excess cornstarch.
2. Heat a wok or large skillet over medium-high heat.  
  Add 1 tablespoon canola oil to pan; swirl to coat.  
  Add half of coated chicken; saut√© **6 minutes** or until done, turning to brown.  
  Remove chicken from pan using a slotted spoon; drain on paper towels.  
  Repeat procedure with remaining 1 tablespoon canola oil and coated chicken.
3. Combine remaining lh teaspoons cornstarch, remaining 2 tablespoons soy sauce, honey, and next 3 ingredients (through sambal oelek)
  in a microwave-safe bowl, stirring with a whisk until smooth.  
  Microwave at HIGH **1.5 minutes** or until slightly thick, stirring twice.  
  Stir in garlic.  
  Combine soy sauce mixture, chicken, peanuts, and celery; toss to coat chicken.
4. Toast tortillas under broiler or on a griddle until lightly blistered, turning
frequently (*or just warm them up in a pan*).  
  Place 2 tortillas on each of 4 plates; divide chicken mixture evenly among tortillas.  
  Top each taco with green onions and bell pepper strips; serve with lime wedges.
