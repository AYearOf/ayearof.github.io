title: Steamed Pork Buns
---

I didn't get these right. Not even close.

And yet, even in their not-even-close state, they disappeared faster
than any other food I made. I was lucky to have had the change to eat one. One!

In short, they're absolutely **delicious** and we can control the size
and make them the size of a sizeable sandwich and thus get a whole meal in one
or make them smaller and move into almost appetizer territory.

Either way, they're a knockout.

## Recipe

They're not the quickest to make as the dough itself takes about 1 hour to rise.

Luckily they can be frozen once prepared so the second time we only take
the time required to steam them.

### Ingredients

Filling: 

* 1/2 teaspoon five-spice powder
* 1 lbs pork tenderloin, trimmed
* Cooking spray
* 1 cup thinly sliced green onions
* 3 tablespoons hoisin sauce
* 2 tablespoons rice vinegar
* 1 tablespoon lower-sodium soy sauce
* 1 1/2 teaspoons honey
* 1 teaspoon minced peeled fresh ginger
* 1 teaspoon minced fresh garlic (*I'd use double, at least*)
* 1/4 teaspoon salt

Dough: 

* 1 cup warm water (100F to 110F)
* 3 tablespoons sugar
* 1 package dry yeast (about 2 1/4 teaspoons)
* 14.6 ounces all-purpose flour (about 3 1/4 cups) (*easier to go by weight than volume*)
* 3 tablespoons canola oil
* 1/4 teaspoon salt
* Cooking spray
* 1 1/2 teaspoons baking powder

### Preparation

1. To prepare filling, rub five-spice powder evenly over pork.  
  Heat a grill pan over medium-high heat.  
  Coat pan with cooking spray.  
  Add pork to pan; cook **14 minutes** or until a thermometer registers **145F**, turning pork occasionally.  
  Remove pork from pan, and let stand **15 minutes**.
2. Cut pork crosswise into thin slices; cut slices into thin strips.  
  Place pork in a medium bowl.  
  Add onions and next 7 ingredients (through 1/4 teaspoon salt); stir well to combine.  
  Cover and refrigerate.
3. To prepare dough, combine 1 cup warm water, sugar, and yeast in a large bowl; 
let stand 5 minutes.
4. Weigh or lightly spoon flour into dry measuring cups; level with a knife.  
  Add flour, oil, and 1/4 teaspoon salt to yeast mixture; stir until a soft dough forms.  
  Turn dough out onto a lightly floured surface.  
  Knead until smooth and elastic (about **10 minutes**).  
  Place dough in a large bowl coated with cooking spray, turning to 
coat top.  
  Cover and let rise in a warm place (85F - *can use proofing drawer or oven*), free from drafts, **1 hour** or until doubled in size.
  (Gently press two fingers into dough. If indentation remains, dough has risen enough.)
5. Punch dough down; let rest **5 minutes**.  
  Turn dough out onto a clean surface; kneadin baking powder.  
  Let dough rest **5 minutes**.
6. Diyide dough into 10 equal portions, forming each into a ball.  
  Working with 1 dough ball at a time (cover remaining dough balls to keep from drying), roll ball into a 5-inch circle.  
  Place 1/4 cup filling in center of dough circle.  
  Bring up sides to cover filling and meet on top.  
  Pinch and seal closed with a twist.  
  Repeat procedure with remaining dough balls and filling. 
7. Arrange 5 buns, seam sides down, 1 inch apart, in each tier of a 2-tiered bamboo steamer.  
  Stack tiers; cover with lid. 
8. Add water to a large skillet to a depth of 1 inch; bring to a boil over medium-high heat.  
  Place steamer in pan; steam **15 minutes** or until puffed and set.  
  Cool **10 minutes before serving**.
