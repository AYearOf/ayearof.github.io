title: Dak Bokkeum - Korean Stewed Chicken with Spinach
---

Delicious recipe, if a bit spicy. Good kind of spicy.

Definitely a remake. A multiple-time remake.

## Recipe

Takes about 30-40 minutes of prep time, to a total
of about 1.5 hours.

The recipe calls for 1 small bag of spinach;
I would suggest using only half or 3 quarters and
adding one or two big potatoes, cubed, to the mix right
at the beginning of the cooking phase.

### Ingredients

* 1/3 cup gochujang (Korean Chile paste) (*so delicious I've been eating it on bread*)
* 1/4 cup (1/2-inch) slices green onion bottoms
* 2 1/2 tablespoons lower-sodium soy sauce
* 2 tablespoons minced fresh garlic (*can add more, but it'll be even spicier*)
* 2 tablespoons minced peeled fresh ginger
* 2 tablespoons dark sesame oil
* 1 tablespoon brown sugar
* 3/4 teaspoon crushed red pepper
* 2 pounds skinless, boneless chicken thighs, cut into 1/2-inch strips (*use chicken breasts - easier to deal with*)
* 1 1/2 cups uncooked short-grain white rice
* 1 1/2 cups water
* 1/3 cup water
* 3/4 cup (1 1/2-inch) slices green onion tops
* 1 (5-ounce) bag fresh baby spinach (*I used only half and added potatoes instead*)
* 1 tablespoon toasted sesame seeds

### Preparation

1. Combine first 8 ingredients (through the crushed red pepper) in a large bowl.  
  Stir in chicken.  
  Cover and marinate **30 minutes**.
2. Place rice in a medium saucepan; cover with water to 2 inches above rice.  
  Stir rice; drain.  
  Repeat procedure twice.  
  Add 1.5 cups water to drained rice in pan.  
  Bring to a boil over medium-high heat.  
  Cover, reduce heat, and simmer **20 minutes**.  
  Remove from heat; let stand **10 minutes**.
3. While rice cooks, bring 1/3 cup water to a boil in a Dutch oven.  
  Add chicken mixture; bring to a simmer.  
  Cover, reduce heat, and simmer 20 minutes.  
  Uncover and simmer 10 minutes or until mixture thickens, stirring occasionally.  
  Remove from heat; stir in green onion tops and spinach.  
  Sprinkle with sesame seeds.

Serve with rice. Serves 6 (serving size: 1 cup chicken mixture and  3/4 cup rice)
