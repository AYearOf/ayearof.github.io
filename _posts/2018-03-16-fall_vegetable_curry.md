title: Fall Vegetable Curry
---

I'm perfectly away that March is in Spring,
but all the "fall vegetables" in this curry - a variation on a
[Chana Masala](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chana_masala) theme -
are available right now and most of them even in the house.

It's a recipe that's delicious, quick to make and given it's vegetarian, it also makes for a great Friday meal during the time of Lent.

## Recipe

Takes about 15-20 minutes of prep to a total of 25-30 minutes total.

The difference for me was substituting *some* sweet potatoes with
regular potatoes, and the latter take a bit longer to cook.

### Ingredients

* 1 1/2 teaspoons olive oil
* 1 cup diced peeled sweet potato (*or 1/2 cup sweet and 1/2 cup regular potatoes*)
* 1 cup small cauliflower florets
* 1/4 cup thinly sliced yellow onion
* 2 teaspoons Madras curry powder
* 1/2 cup organic vegetable broth
* 1/4 teaspoon salt
* 1 (15-ounce) can chickpeas (garbanzo beans), rinsed and drained
* 1 (14.5-ounce) can no-salt- added diced tomatoes, undrained
* 2 cups hot cooked basmati rice
* 1/2 cup plain 2% reduced-fat Greek yogurt (*mix in some carrots and cucumbers for a delicious topping*)
* 2 tablespoons chopped fresh cilantro
* 1/4 cup of cashews

### Preparation

1. Heat a large nonstick skillet over medium-high heat.  
  Add olive oil to pan; swirl to coat.  
  Add sweet potato to pan; saut√© **3 minutes**.  
  Decrease heat to medium.
  Add cauliflower, onion, and curry powder; cook **1 minute**, stirring mixture constantly.  
  Add broth and next 3 ingredients (through tomatoes); bring to a boil.  
  Cover, reduce heat, and simmer **10 minutes** or until vegetables are tender (*test the potatoes - they take the longest*), stirring occasionally.  

Serve over rice and with yogurt. Sprinkle with cilantro and cashews.
