title: Canadian Meat Pie (Tourtiere)
---

I feel I should be apologizing to any Canadians
coming across this post for butchering what seems
to be a delicious dish and a variation, with French influences,
of the meat pies of the United Kingdom (Guinness pie - yum).

I understand it's normally done as a proper pie - crust bottom and top -
but the recipe I had uses a ramekin and crust only on top.
I guess it's healthier that way.

I messed it up in experimenting with the crust and instead of using
pie crust like the recipe calls for, I use biscuit mix.

Because Texas.

Don't get me wrong - it's still delicious, but I think the biscuit
mix (freedom biscuit not the Commonwealth kind) drained some of the
moisture from the mix. Or maybe we're too used with the somewhat
similar-looking shepherd pie and the metric ton of gravy is contains.

## Recipe

### Ingredients

* Cooking spray
* 1 pound ground pork
* 1/2 teaspoon salt
* 1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon
* 1/8 teaspoon ground red pepper
* 1/8 teaspoon ground cloves
* 1 tablespoon olive oil
* 1 cup finely chopped onion
* 1/2 cup finely chopped carrot
* 1/3 cup finely chopped celery
* 1 pound russet potatoes, peeled and cut into 1/4-inch cubes
* 3 garlic cloves, minced
* 2 tablespoons all-purpose flour
* 1 1/2 cups fat-free, lower-sodium chicken broth
* 3 tablespoons finely chopped fresh chives
* 1/2 (14.1-ounce) package refrigerated pie dough
* 1 pound ground pork

### Preparation

1. Preheat oven to 400F.
2. Heat a large skillet over medium-high heat.  
  Coat pan with cooking spray.
  Add pork to pan.  
  Sprinkle pork with salt, cinnamon, red pepper, and cloves; sauté **5 minutes** or until browned, stirring to crumble.  
  Using a slotted spoon, remove pork from pan.  
  Add oil to pan; swirl to coat.  
  Add onion, carrot, celery, and potato; sauté **5 minutes**.  
  Add garlic, and sauté **1 minute**.  
  Return pork to pan.  
  Stir in flour, and cook **1 minute**, stirring constantly.  
  Add broth, scraping pan to loosen browned bits; bring to a boil.  
  Cook **2 minutes** or until slightly thick.
  Remove from heat; stir in chives.
3. Place 1 cup pork mixture into each of 6 (8-ounce) ramekins.  
  Roll pie dough to an 11-inch circle.  
  Cut 4 (5-inch) dough circles.  
  Combine and re-roll dough scraps.  
  Cut 2 (5-inch) circles.  
  Place 1 dough circle on each ramekin, tucking edges inside.  
  Cut an X in the top of each circle; coat lightly with cooking spray.
  Place ramekins on a baking sheet.  
  Bake at 400F for **40 minutes** or until golden and bubbly.
  
Serves 6

*Note*: If you don't have ramekins, spoon the filling into a 9-inch pie plate, and
top with the entire pastry.
