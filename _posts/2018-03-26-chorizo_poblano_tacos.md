title: Poblano, Potato, and Chorizo Tacos
---

A meal so good I've been asked to make it again almost weekly.

We've had all kinds of tacos -- the beef tacos used to rule supreme --
but after this adventure, move out all other meats: we have a new king,
Chorizo.

Mexican chorizo - it's an important difference because the origin of this
delicious pork sausage [is Spain and Portugal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chorizo).
However, that version is a bit different as it's fermented, cured and smoked and
can be sliced as you would slice salami.

We saw a version of that Spanish/Portuguese chorizo
in the [Caldo Verde - Portuguese Greens Soup](portuguese_greens_sould.html).

The Mexican version is made with chili peppers, surprisingly uncommon in *traditional* Mexican cuisine,
and it's closer to what you'd typically think of a sausage. And obviously it's
spicier, but not a burning heat more of an delicious, enchanting aftertaste.

The grease on the taco above was a mistake in the cooking process: I used
too much chorizo.

## Recipe

There's a lot of variation in the sausage itself - depending on brand,
so I am experimenting to see which yields the best result.

The recipe calls for 3 ounces of chorizo, but I'd honestly use twice
that amount for how delicious it is.

Either way, it produces a large amount of grease, so I think it would help
if one were to increase a bit the amount of potatoes. I'd say one extra
cup of cubed potatoes for each 3 extra ounces of chorizo.

Speaking of which, I would recommend increasing the time you spend
cooking the potatoes in the first phase (see below).
The second time I made the recipe I cooked them till they started browning,
almost close to country potato fries. It added a bit of crunch
to the taco and also soaked more of the grease.

### Ingredients

* 2 poblano chiles
* 1 tablespoon canola oil
* 2 cups diced white potato (*depending on how you feel about potatoes, I'd
  use more - 1 extra cup per 3 oz of extra chorizo*)
* 1 cup chopped onion
* 1 cup fresh corn kernels
* 1/8 teaspoon ground red pepper
* 5 garlic cloves, minced
* 3 ounces Mexican raw (*use double - it's delicious!*)
* chorizo, casings removed
* 3/4 cup unsalted chicken stock
* 3/8 teaspoon kosher salt
* 8 (6-inch) corn tortillas
* 1/4 cup sliced green onions
* 1 ounce Manchego cheese, shredded (about 1/4 cup)
* 8 lime wedges

### Preparation

1. Preheat broiler.
2. Cut poblanos in half lengthwise; discard seeds and membranes.  
  Place poblano halves, skin sides up, on a foil-lined baking sheet; flatten with hand.  
  Broil **8 minutes** or until blackened.  
  Place in a paper bag; fold to close tightly. Let stand **5 minutes**.  
  Peel; coarsely chop.
3. Heat a large nonstick skillet over medium-high heat.  
  Add oil to pan; swirl to coat.  
  Add potato; cook **5 minutes** (*I'd say cook till they're done*), stirring occasionally.  
  Remove potato; place in a large bowl.  
  Add onion to pan; cook **3 minutes**.  
  Add poblano, corn, red pepper, and garlic; cook **2 minutes**, stirring frequently.  
  Add onion mixture to potato.  
  Add chorizo to pan; cook **1.5 minutes** (*adjust this based on how long it takes to propertly cook*),
  stirring to crumble.  
  Return potato mixture to pan.  
  Stir in stock and salt; bring to a boil.  
  Partially cover, reduce heat, and simmer **6 minutes** or until potato is tender, chorizo is done, and liquid almost evaporates.
4. Working with 1 tortilla at a time,
   heat tortillas over medium-high heat directly
   on the eye of a burner for about 15 seconds on each side or until lightly charred.

Arrange about 1/3 cup potato mixture in center of each tortilla;
top with 1/2 teaspoons onions and 1/2 teaspoons cheese.

Serve with lime wedges.
