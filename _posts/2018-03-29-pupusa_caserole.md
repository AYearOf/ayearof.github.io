title: Pupusa Casserole
---

[Traditional pupusas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pupusa) are thick pancake-like dish
stuffed with some sort of savory filling.

The version in this recipe is a casserole instead of the tortilla version and that
makes a bit of a difference as it allows to produce a larger amount with smaller effort
since it does not require that each pupusa is cooked individually.

It was delicious dish as evidenced by half of it being gone before I had a chance to take a shot.

The second surprise to this recipe is the addition of an ingredient I never used before:
*nopalitos* or cactus paddles.

I did not what to expect and was pleasantly surprised; they taste like milder pickles
and complement the sweetness of the corn flour (masa harina) in a perfect way.

## Recipe

Realistic prep time for me was close to 45 minutes with a total cooking time of
about an hour and a half, but don't let that be a discouragement - it was an easy
to make meal.

### Ingredients

* 2 cups nopalitos (about 6 chopped nopales, cactus paddles)
* 2 (4-ounce) skinless, boneless chicken breast halves
* 1/2 teaspoon salt
* 1/2 teaspoon ground cumin
* 1/4 teaspoon freshly groUnd black pepper
* Cooking spray
* 3/4 cup finely chopped onion
* 2 garlic cloves, minced
* 4 ounces shredded Monterey Jack cheese with jalapeño peppers (about 1 cup), divided

*Dough:*

* 7.7 ounces masa harina (about 2 1/4 cups) - *go for 8 ounces*
* 1 cup water - *I found I needed to add more as I shaped the dough*
* 1 teaspoon salt

### Preparation

1. Preheat oven to 375F. (*do this later - it takes a while to make the filling*)
2. To prepare filling. cook nopalitos in boiling water **10 minutes**.  
  Drain.
3. Sprinkle chicken with 1/2 teaspoon salt, cumin, and pepper.  
  Heat a medium skillet over medium heat.  
  Coat pan with cooking spray.  
  Add chicken; cook **4 minutes** on each side or until done.  
  Remove chicken from pan; cool slightly, and shred with 2 forks.
4. Heat pan over medium heat.  
   Add onion and garlic; sauté **4 minutes** or until tender.  
   Stir in nopalitos, chicken, and 2/3 cup cheese.  
   Cook **5 minutes** or until thoroughly heated.  
5. To prepare dough, weigh or lightly spoon masa harina in dry measuring cups; level with a knife.  
  Combine masa harina, 1 up water, and 1 teaspoon salt in a medium bowl.  
  Turn dough out onto a lightly floured surface; knead lightly.  
  Press one-third of dough into an 11 x 7—inch baking dish coated with cooking spray.  
  Spread filling over dough.  
  Gently press remaining dough into a 4-inch square on heavy-duty plastic wrap.  
  Cover with additional plastic wrap.  
  Roll, still covered, into an 11 x 7—inch rectangle.  
  Remove bottom sheet of plastic wrap; fit dough over filling.  
  Remove top sheet of plastic wrap.  
  Bake at 3750 for **20 minutes**.  
  Sprinkle with 1/3 cup cheese.  
  Bake an additional **5 minutes** or until cheese melts.
