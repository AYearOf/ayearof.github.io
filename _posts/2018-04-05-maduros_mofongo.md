title: Chicken Mofongo and Maduros
---

This is a 2-for-1 because these two recipes go well together and they both
have plantains in common.

Ideally, you would serve the *maduros* or sautéed sweet plantains as a desert --
they are certainly sweet enough to warrant that. We liked them so much that
we ate the entire desert while waiting for the mofongo to cook.

Onto the mofongo now. In a whole week of visiting Puerto Rico,
I don't think I ever had a traditional meal that was not both bland and delicious.

It seems weird to say that yet it's however true. The meals were well balanced,
not overly spicy (spice-y not hot) and thus seemingly bland to my more
adventurous (or perhaps less discerning) palate. Yet every single one of those
meals has been great at that moment in time; just not memorable beyond their
surprising blandness/balance.

The mofongo here is no difference - the chicken is tasty but they plantains
don't have enough oomph to add something remarkable to this dish.

In contrast, the maduros are actually pleasantly suprising - it allows the
sweetness to shine while the softness of the plantain brings a textural
suprise - they're like a caribbean version of the macaron.

I would totally make the maduros again, but pass on the mofongo.
