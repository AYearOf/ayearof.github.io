title: Cycle 6 South-east Asia - Indonesian Stir-Fried Noodles (Bakmi Goreng)
---

I almost don't want to post a photo of this meal because I botched it pretty badly.

I cooked the noodles for too long so ended up with a mush of starch. The lesson here is follow the recipe.

At the top of the picture is what they're supposed to look like. At the bottom is my disgrace.

They were pretty good though.

## Recipe

I'd say it takes about 40 minutes to an hour of cooking, much of it hands-on.

The recipe calls for a type of sauce called *Kecap manis* - Indonesia's version
of ketchup. The explanation text for the recipe indicates how to make it:

> Mix 1 part molasses, 2 parts brown sugar, and 3 parts soy sauce
with crushed garlic and ground star anise. Heat the mixture until
the sugar dissolves.

### Ingredients

3 tablespoons peanut oil, divided
2 large eggs, lightly beaten
6 ounces dried Chinese egg noodles or spaghetti
6 ounces skinless, boneless chicken breast, thinly sliced
4 ounces boneless pork loin chop, sliced
2 garlic cloves, minced
2 cups thinly sliced Napa cabbage (*I used regular cabbage*)
3/4 cup sliced green onions
1 celery stalk, thinly sliced
3 tablespoons fat-free, lower-sodium chicken broth
1 tablespoon kecap manis (sweet soy sauce)
1 tablespoon lower-sodium soy sauce
1/2 cup packaged fried onions

### Preparation

1. Heat a large nonstick skillet over medium-high heat.  
  Add 1 tablespoon oil; swirl to coat.  
  Pour eggs into pan; swirl to form a thin omelet.  
  Cook **1 minute** or until cooked on bottom.  
  Carefully turn omelet over; cook **30 seconds**.  
  Remove from pan.  
  Roll up omelet; cut roll crosswise into thin strips.  
  Keep warm.
2. Cook noodles according to package directions.  
  Drain and rinse with cold water; drain and set aside.
3. Heat a wok over high heat.  
  Add remaining 2 tablespoons oil to pan; swirl to coat.  
  Add chicken, pork, and garlic; stir-fry **1.5 minutes**.  
  Add cabbage, green onions, and celery; stir-fry **1 minute**.  
  Stir in broth, kecap manis, and soy sauce.  
  Add noodles; stir-fry **3 minutes** or until thoroughly heated and noodles begin to lightly brown.  
  Add egg; toss gently.  
  Top with fried onions.  
  Serve immediately.
