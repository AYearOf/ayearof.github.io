title: Indonesian Vegetable Salad
---

My salads tend to be fairly boring: lettuce, tomatoes, onion, cucumbers,
usually tossed with oil and balsamic vinegar.

This was an opportunity to do something a bit different and to be honest
this is quite a departure from normal salads.

It looks great too!

The [Cooking Light](https://www.amazon.com/dp/0848739981/ref=cm_sw_r_cp_api_rVDBAbKBFPNH3) book
calls this recipe *Shortcut Gado Gado*.

I think I might look online for a more authentic *Gado Gado* recipe the next time I'm in a mood to make it.


## Recipe

The only downside to this salad is that it takes close to an hour to make.

The incredible upside is that the tofu, which I typically don't favor,
ended up finger-licking delicious. Seriously - I think we ate the tofu
pretty much by itself and I'm looking forward to making it again.

### Ingredients

4 large eggs
1 1/2 cups julienne-cut carrot
1 1/2 cups green beans, trimmed
11/2 cups fresh bean sprouts*
1 red bell pepper, seeded and cut into thin strips
1/2 English cucumber, halved lengthwise and cut crosswise into 1/4-inch-thick slices (about 2 cups)
1 (14-ounce) package of water-packed extra-firm tofu, drained
1 tablespoon cornstarch
2 teaspoons red curry powder or Madras curry powder (*or mix both!*)
1/4 teaspoon salt
2 tablespoons canola oil
1/3 cup creamy peanut butter
3 tablespoons hot water
3 tablespoons fresh lime juice
1 tablespoon lower-sodium soy sauce
2 teaspoons brown sugar
2 teaspoons Thai red curry paste
1/4 teaspoon salt

### Preparation

(*You'll be needing a lot of larger bowls.*)

1. Place eggs in a large saucepan; cover with water.
  Bring to a rolling boil; cover, remove from heat,  and let stand **12 minutes**.  
  Remove eggs from pan with a slotted spoon; rinse with cold water.  
  Peel eggs; cut in half.
2. Return water to a boil.  
  Add carrot, and cook **1 minute**.  
  Remove carrot wih slotted spoon; drain and rinse with cold water.  
  Drain and place in a bowl.
  Add green beans to boiling water, and cook **4 minutes** or until crisp-tender.  
  Remove green beans with a slotted spoon; drain and place in a separate bowl.  
  Arrange 2 egg halves, about 1/3 cup carrot, 1/3 cup green beans, 1/3 cup bean sprouts, 1/4 cup red bell pepper, and 1/2 cup cucumber on each of 4 plates.
3. Cut tofu lengthwise into 4 (1/2-inch-thick) slices.  
  Place tofu slices on several layers of paper towels.  
  Cover tofu with additional paper towels; let stand **5 minutes**.
  (*You're looking to dry the tofu as much as possible*)  
  Cut each tofu slice crosswise into 1/2-inch-thick strips.  
  Combine cornstarch, curry powder, and 1/4 teaspoon salt;
  gently toss with tofu to coat.
4. Heat a large nonstick skillet over medium-high heat.  
  Add oil to pan; swirl to coat.
  Add tofu to pan; cook **10 minutes** or until crisp and browned,
  turning to brown on all sides.  
  Divide tofu evenly among plates.
5. Combine peanut butter and next 6 ingredients in a bowl;
  stir with a whisk until smooth.

Serve each salad with about 3 tablespoons dressing.
