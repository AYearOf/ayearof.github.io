title: Classic Pad Thai

Another dish that, while not bad, did not meet up my expectations.

The recipe from Cooking Light was a little bland and lacking in spice
and comparison with other online recipes showed that a good deal of
ingredients seemed to have been left out.

It wasn't an unpleasant dish; if the aim is to produce a restaurant-style
pad thai, this is not the recipe for it.

## Recipe

Takes about 45 minutes and almost all of it it's hands-on.

I don't know where to find the dried shrimp that the recipe calls for.
My grocery store (HEB), which is surprisingly well stocked, did not have it --
I'm sure an Asian grocery store would though.

> **Dried Shrimp**  
> Also known as *kung haeng* (Thailand), *bazun-chauk* (Burma), and *ebi* (Indonesia),
sun-dried small shrimp provide a layer of umami (savory) flavor in Southeast Asian cooking.
They're often tossed into simmering dishes to rehydrate the shrimp and release the flavors,
but sometimes the dried shrimp are just added whole.
They can even be ground to a powder and sprinkled like salt as a seasoning.
Don't confuse dried shrimp with shrimp paste, a more pungent fermented paste
known as *kapi* (Thailand), *terasi* (Indonesia), and *belacan* (Malaysia).
