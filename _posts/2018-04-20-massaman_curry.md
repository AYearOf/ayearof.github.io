title: Massaman Curry
---

I remember getting *Massaman curry* once or twice at Thai places
and always liking it, but not loving it, and as a result it
wasn't the go-to dish even with a large group.

The recipe I followed didn't produce the rich brown curry that I remember
ordering, but instead ended up somewhat liquidy and pleasant, but
not *rich* taste.

It's supposed to look close to this instead:

Anyway, I'm determined to make it again and find a better recipe
because it's an interesting curry that's somewhat aside from the norm.

In a way if feels closer to a north-Indian curry (not that I'm an expert),
with the addition of typical Thai ingredients: lemongrass and coconut milk.

The history of the curry is intriguing because it's not a
native Thai curry -- even the work *massaman* is borrowed --
but instead a take on a Thai curry heavily influenced by
Muslim spice traders.
