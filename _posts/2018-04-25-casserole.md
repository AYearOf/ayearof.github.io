title: Cycle 7 Slow Cooker - Family Favorite Casserole
---

For the next cycle of two weeks, maybe even 4 weeks,
I'm going to try slow-cooker recipes because I've never cooked
with a slow-cooker before and I would like to understand
its benefits and limitations.

The first recipe was by far selected simply based on what I had
available in the house since a rainy day made it unlikely to
go out to the store.

The recipe is called *Family Favorite Casserole* and as far
as I could tell it was quite simple: throw in some ground beef,
some veggies, and a can of mushroom soup.

I can do that.

The results may not look pretty, but due to some liberties I've
taken I ended up with another delicious meal on my hands.

I don't really know who's family found this to be a favorite
(the author's, I guess), but I can tell you mine liked it.

The additions I made to the recipe definitely had something to do with it.

## Recipe

Hands-on time: 10-20 minutes, cook time: 6-10 hours on low or 3-4 on high.

### Ingredients

* 1 pound ground beef, browned and drained
* 1 medium onion, chopped
* 1 1/2 cups diced potatoes
* 1 1/2 cups baby carrots, cut in thirds
* 1/2 teaspoon salt
* I can (10.5 ounces) cream of mushroom soup, condensed
* 1/2 cup milk
* 1 1/2 cups elbow macaroni, cooked
* 2 cups grated cheddar cheese

My additions:

* 2-3 slices of maple-peppered bacon, cut in 1-inch pieces
* 2-3 jalapenos, seeded and chopped

### Preparation

Combine all ingredients except milk, macaroni, and cheese in greased
3 1/2 to 5-quart slow cooker.  
Stir to combine.  
Cover and cook on **low heat for 6—10 hours** or on **high heat for 3—4 hours**.  
Stir in milk and cooked macaroni during the **last 30 minutes** of cooking if on **low heat**
or the last **15 minutes** if on high heat.  
Sprinkle grated cheese over top.

Serve with buttery steamed asparagus.

Makes 6-8 servings.
