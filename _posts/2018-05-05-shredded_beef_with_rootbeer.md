title: Shredded Beef with Root-beer Sandwiches
---

Short of regular sandwiches,
this is quite possible the simplest recipe I can think of.

You take beef, rootbeer, and BBQ sauce and combine them in
a slow cooker. Put on bread. Eat.

With that out of the way, the beef ends up quite tasty -
even though I couldn't really taste the rootbeer's sarsaparilla,
but it feels as if it requires more. I think something slightly
acid makes a good side or additional topping; coleslaw probably
works great, pickles do too - as long as they're not too dill-y.

For my taste, I threw together some onion with salt and vinegar.
Some of us added pickled banana peppers - those worked great too.

As far as the bread goes, I would (and did) use something other
than regular hamburger buns. My local HEB bakery makes these
great hamburger rolls - a bit larger and softer than regular
burger buns and quite tasty too. While I love pretzel buns,
I don't think they would work. Garlic bread might. Sourdough
definitely would.

The limited ingredients and ease of preparation makes
this a great recipe for social gatherings; where burgers
are appropriate, this is an upgrade.

## Recipe

Pierce the raw meat a few times with a fork - it'll help the juices
go in.

Select a delicious root beer - preferably something craft
that uses real sarsaparilla root. **Do not use diet rootbeer**

### Ingredients

* 3-4 lbs extra lean beef roast
* 1 can or bottle of 12 oz root beer (*get 2 - I'll explain*)
* 1 1/2 cup of BBQ sauce (*get a bottle of at least 16 oz*)
* 6-pack of hamburger buns (*see above*)

### Preparation

The ingredients, as stated above are for a smaller 3.5â€“4 quart
slow cooker. If you have a 6 quart one, you will need more liquid.

I would increase the quantity by 1.5x or maybe even 2x: instead
of a can of rootbeer, use 2, instead of a 1.5 cups or BBQ sauce
use 2 or even 2.5. **Save some BBQ sauce for serving**.

You want the meat *completely covered* in liquid, preferably
with a bit on top to allow for evaporation.

1. Puncture the beef with a fork.  
   Lay in greased cooker.  
   Mix rootbeer and BBQ sauce; add to cooker.
   Cook on *slow* for **8-10** hours.  

When done, shred the beef with two forks - it'll come apart really
easy. Scoop on buns with BBQ sauce and some sort of side.
