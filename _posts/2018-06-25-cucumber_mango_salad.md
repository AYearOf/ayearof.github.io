title: Cucumber Mango Salad
---

Most of the salads I make are some sort
of variations of things on top of lettuce.
Not that I like lettuce much -- it's just that
it doesn't have many calories so it's a good filler.

I did make a few salads that were not lettuce-based:

* the [Peruvian sarsa salad](/peruvian_sarsa_salad), which was delicious;
* the [Indonesian vegetable salad](/indonesian_vegetable_salad), which I liked;
* the [Süßkartoffelsalat aka German Sweet Potato Salad](/german_sweet_potato_salad) (is it really a salad?).

All of which more or less I liked.

Time for another one, a bit of a sweet version.

It's an interesting balance and maybe
more of an acquired taste. I didn't love it
and also didn't hate it.

The onion and mango make for an interesting interplay,
while the cooked tomato counters the freshness of the mango.

## Recipe

It takes about 30-35 minutes to make, most of it waiting for
cooked ingredients to cool down.

The ingredients below serve 6 assuming you serve it as a side
to something. If by itself, I am not sure it works as
the serving size is 2/3 cup - like who eats by the small
measure?!

### Ingredients

* 2 cups thinly sliced English cucumber (about 1 cucumber)
* 1 1/2 cups finely chopped red onion
* 1/2 teaspoon salt
* 1 garlic clove, minced
* 1 teaspoon peanut oil
* 2 cups chopped seeded tomato (about 1 pound)
* 3 tablespoons chopped unsalted, dry-roasted peanuts
* 1 tablespoon finely chopped seeded red jalapeöo pepper (about 1)
* 1 tablespoon finely chopped seeded green jalapeöo pepper (about 1)
* 1/4 teaspoon coriander seeds, crushed
* 1/4 teaspoon ground cumin
* 1/8 teaspoon ground red pepper
* Dash of ground cinnamon
* Dash of ground cloves
* 1 3/4 cups diced peeled ripe mango (about 1)
* 1 tablespoon chopped fresh cilantro
* 3 tablespoons fresh lime juice

### Preparation

1. Combine first 4 ingredients in a colander; toss gently.
  Let stand at least 20 minutes. 
2. Heat a large skillet over medium-high head.  
  Add oil to pan; swirl to coat.  
  Add tomato and next 8 ingredients (through ground cloves) to pan;  
  sauté 5 minutes or until tomato is tender.  
  Remove from heat; cool to room temperature (about 20 minutes).
3. Combine drained cucumber mixture, tomato mixture,
  and remaining ingredients in a medium bowl;  
  toss gently to combine.
