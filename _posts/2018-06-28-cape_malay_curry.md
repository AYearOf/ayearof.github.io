[Cape Malays](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cape_Malays)
are an ethnic group from South Africa with one
of the most interesting backgrounds, which is properly reflected
in their cuisine.

Owing to some their Southeast Asian roots and blending
Arab influences by way of their Muslim identity,
the food contains harmonious artifacts of those origins:
turmeric abd cinnamon, ginger and beef, bell peppers
and apricots all combine in this recipe in a delicious
mix.
