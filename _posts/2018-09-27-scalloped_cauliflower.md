title: Scalloped Cauliflower
---

Think of this dish as a paleo/keto alternative
to mac & cheese. It is, honestly, suprisingly
delicious and I personally would prefer
it over mac & cheese due to the crispiness
that the cauliflower brings.

This is a great recipe as a learning tool too,
as it allows one to learn one of the main
five or "mother sauces: the *Sauce Béchamel*,
without too much opportunity to screw up in the main part of the dish.

All the more props to the [*Joy of Cooking*](http://a.co/d/8lhWZQ3) book (1997 edition = best edition).

## Recipe

Timing wise, there's about 10 minutes
on hands-on with the Béchamel,
about 30 of cooking time.

As an order of events, prepare the
cauliflower florets and the grated cheese
before-hand as the Béchamel should be poured
on while still hot.

Use a good quality cheese: Gruyère, aged Cheddar,
Parmesan, or smoked Gouda work really well.

### Ingredients

* 2 lbs of cauliflower, cut into small florets
* 1/2 tbsp salt
* juice of 1 lemon or about 1/4 cup of lemon juice
* 2/3 cups of grated cheese (add 1 full cup
  for extra-cheesiness)
* 1 tbsp Dijon mustard (or 1/2 tsp of ground nutmeg)
* 1/2 cup breadcrumbs (can experiment with various flavors)
* 1 tbsp of red pepper flakes, ground red pepper,
  or paprika

#### Sauce Béchamel

Piece of advice: like most sauces it's a bit easier
to thin out than it is to thicken.

* 1 1/4 cups milk
* 1/4 onion
* 1 bay leaf
* 2 whole cloves
* pinch of fresh grated nutmeg (option)
* 2 tbsp unsalted butter
* 2 tbsp all-purpose flour

For thicker sauce, increase the butter and flour
by 1 tablespoon each.

### Preparation

For the Béchamel the keyword is *slowly*.

1. Preheat the over to 350F.
   Butter a 2-quart gratin dish.
2. Boil the cauliflower with 1/2 tbsp salt and the lemon juice
   in 8 quarts of water, for **10 to 15 minutes** or until
   the cauliflower is tender yet still crisp.
3. Drain well and spread in the gratin dish.  
   Sprinkle with the grated cheese.
4. Stick the bay leaf to the quarter onion using the two whole cloves.  
   Simmer in the milk gently, uncovered to infuse flavor into the milk.  
   Discard.
5. Meanwhile, in a medium, heavy saucepan, melt over low heat the 2 tablespoons of butter.  
    Gently stir in the all-purpose flower, ensuring all clumps are removed.  
    Cook over medium-low heat for **2 or 3 minutes** until the roux
    (the mix) is just fragrant but not darkened.  
    Remove from heat and let cool slightly.  
    *Slowly* whisk in the warm milk and return to heat.  
    Bring the sauce slowly to a simmer over low heat without boiling,
    whisking to prevent lumps;
    stir often and skim any skin that forms, until it reaches
    the consistency of thick cream soup, about **8 to 10 minutes**.
6. Mix 1 1/2 cup of the sauce with 1 tablespoon of Dijon mustard
   and spoon over the cauliflower.
7. Sprinkle 1/3 cup of grated cheese along with
   the breadcrumbs.  
   Bake until bubbly and browned on top, about **25 minutes**.
8. Serve sprinkled with the pepper flakes.
