title: Hungarian Goulash
---

This is a reciped based off [Cooking Light Global Kitchen](https://www.amazon.com/dp/0848739981/ref=cm_sw_r_cp_api_rVDBAbKBFPNH3).

Technically, it's closer to a paprikash in ingredients,
but in America, due to the German-counterpart,
we call this noodle and meat not-quite-stew a goulash,
and given the Hungarian influences of paprika,
we will refer to it as Hungarian goulash.

Regardless, it's another delicious dish for colder days,
as stews are meant to be.

The flavors in here come from the tomato and pepper base
against the cooling effect of the sour cream,
while the textures mix delightfully: noodles, meat,
peppers.

## Recipe

Like most stews, takes a longer time to cook;
unlike most stews, this is a bit more hands-on,
not as much in preparation but in constant
on/off handling.

### Ingredients

* 1 garlic clove, crushed
* 1 teaspoon kosher salt, divided
* 1/4 teaspoon caraway seeds, crushed
* 1/4 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper, divided
* Cooking spray
* 1 tablespoon paprika
* 1 (1-pound) pork tenderloin, trimmed and cut into 1-inch pieces
* 2 cups coarsely chopped onion
* 1 bacon slice, finely chopped
* 1 3/4 cups water, divided
* 1 cup chopped seeded tomato
* 3/4 cup beer
* 1/8 teaspoon crushed red pepper
* 3 Hungarian wax Chiles, seeded and cut into I-inch pieces (substitute: banana peppers or pepperroncini or even jalapenos)
* 11/2 tablespoons all-purpose flour
* 8 ounces uncooked egg noodles
* 1 tablespoon butter
* 3 tablespoons sour cream
* Fresh parsley leaves (optional)

### Preparation

1. Place garlic in a small bowl;
   mash with the back of a spoon to form a paste.  
   Add 1/4 teaspoon salt, caraway seeds, and 1/8 teaspoon black pepper.
2. Heat a large Dutch oven over high heat.  
   Coat pan with cooking spray.  
   Combine paprika, 1/4 teaspoon salt, remaining 1/8 teaspoon black pepper,
   and pork in a medium bowl; toss.  
   Add pork to pan; sauté **6 minutes**, browning on all sides.  
   Remove pork from pan.
3. Reduce heat to medium-high; return pan to heat.  
   Add onion and bacon; sauté **7 minutes** or until bacon is done, stirring frequently.  
   Stir in garlic mixture; cook **1 minute**, stirring constantly.  
   Add 1 1/2 cups water, tomato, and beer; bring to a boil.  
   Reduce heat, and simmer **30 minutes**, stirring occasionally.  
   Stir in red pepper and chiles; simmer **15 minutes**.  
   Add pork to pan; simmer **15 minutes**, stirring occasionally.  
   Combine remaining 1/4 cup water and flour in a small bowl; stir with a whisk.  
   Stir flour mixture and remaining 1/2 teaspoon salt into pork mixture.  
   Bring to a boil; cook **1 minute**, stirring constantly.
4. Cook noodles according to package directions, omitting salt and fat.  
   Combine noodles and butter in a medium bowl, stirring until butter melts.  
   Place 1 cup noodles in each of 4 shallow bowls;
   top with 1 cup pork mixture.  
   Top each serving with about 2 teaspoons sour cream.  
   Garnish with parsley, if desired.
