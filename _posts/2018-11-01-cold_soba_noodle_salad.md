This is a recipe off the back of a box
of Simply Asia Soba noodles which
I picked up on sale off the shelves of
my grocery store and ended up being and incredibly
delicious recipe.

There's a lot at play here that makes this tasty:
on the flavor front, we have vinegar and soy sauce,
sugar, oil, toasted sesame, and then veggies;
on the texture front, the softness of the noodles plays superbly
against the firmness of the raw vegetables,
the peppers in particular.

I'd make this again in a heartbeat.

## Recipe

Given the prep can be done while the
noodles are boiling, this can be all
done in under 10 minutes.

### Ingredients

* 7-8 oz of soba noodles (1/2 package of Simply Asia Soba Noodles)
* 3 tbsp, rice vinegar
* 3 tbsp. soy sauce
* 2 tbsp. sugar
* 2 tbsp. oil
* 1 tbsp. toasted sesame seeds
* 1 1/2 cups shredded lettuce (cabagge can be substituted)
* 1/2 cup shredded carrot
* 1/2 cup julienne-cut red bell pepper
* 2 green onions, green part only, thinly sliced

### Preparation

1. Bring large pot of water to boil.  
   Cook noodles in boiling water for 6 minutes or until
   desired tenderness, stirring
   occasionally.  (If water starts to boil over, reduce heat.)  
   Drain well, rinsing lightly with cold water.
2. While noodles are cooking,
   mix vinegar, soy sauce, sugar, oil and sesame seeds in small bowl.  
   Mix well to disolve the sugar.  
   Set aside.  
   Prep the vegetables.
3. Place noodles in large bowl.  
   Add lettuce, carrot and red bell pepper; toss to mix well.  
   Divide noodle salad among serving plates.  
   Sprinkle with onions.  
   Drizzle with dressing.  
   Serve immediately.

Makes 8 servings.
