title: Pozole
---

Pozole is a type of Mexican soup or stew - I guess which
it ends up being depends on the amount of water one uses.

Funny enough, pozole means hominy which is one of the main
ingredients of this dish (I guess it's how we pasta
to refer to either the dish or the ingredients)
and it tends to be a dish made for and around
main holidays, moreso in Mexico: Christmas, birthdays,
etc.

I think it owes this special place due to the nature
of the corn in Mesoamerican culture. The typical meat
in the pozole is pork and that's due to another
historic reason: the Aztecs made the stew with
white corn - the nominal hominy=pozole - and...
left over meat from human sacrifices ðŸ¤¢.

Turns out that pork tasted "very similar" to human
flesh (hello bacony brother) and since
the cannibalism was banned after the "Spanish Conquest"
pork took its place.

The dish is delicious and not overly difficult
to make from scratch - the ingredients might
be a bit hard to come by.

However, what I came by was a jar of
[Pedro's Posole from Cookwell & Co](https://cookwell.net/products/pedros-pasole)
and thus I cheated the process a bit.

The pozole is typically getting served garnished
with shredded cabbage, thinly sliced radishes,
avocado, cilantro, onion, and lime wedges.

I opted to go without the last two and I wish I had a wider
bowl to better showcase the stew itself - in the
photo above my garnishes became... toppings.

## Recipe
