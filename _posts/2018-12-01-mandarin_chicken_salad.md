title: Mandarin Chicken Salad
---

This is a fairly filling salad which can be easily
served as a main course meal.

The inspiration from it is [Mel's Kitchen Cafe][mel]
blog, which I highly recommend for its diverse
and delicious recipes.

Mel's [version][mel], aside from considerably better photography,
uses chow mein noodles, which I did not have. However,
one can make chow mein even from spaghetti by frying them
after boiling the pasta almost to completion.

I also used shredded rather than chopped chicken.
I think using choped or at least larger pieces of shredded
chicken would have helped.

As a note, don't let a kid that's determined
to make this into a sandwich near it.  
They will use the extra 3 cups of chicken you had
other plans for to turn this salad into the other
kind of chicken salad that you put in sandwiches.

## Recipe

The recipe calls for 3 cups of shredded chicken and
I think that strikes a good balance. However one
could add a bit more if desired to make it more
filling, or a bit more cabbage and lettuce to make it
more airy.

### Ingredients

- 3-4 cups shredded cabbage (can use coleslaw mix)
- 3-4 cups chopped romaine lettuce
- 2 cans (11-ounces each) mandarin oranges, drained
- 3 cups cooked, chopped chicken
- 3 green onions, chopped (red onions also look cool)

For dressing:

- 2 tablespoons low-sodium soy sauce
- 3 tablespoons rice vinegar
- 1 teaspoon minced fresh ginger
- 2 tablespoons olive oil
- 1 teaspoon sesame oil
- 1-2 teaspoons chile-garlic sauce (can use Sambal Oelek if available)
- 1 clove garlic, minced
- 1 tablespoon honey
- Salt and pepper to taste

For topping:

- 1-2 cups chow mein noodles or toasted, chopped almonds (or both)

### Preparation

1. Mix together all incredients for the dressing.
2. In a large bowl, toss the the salad ingredients.
3. Add the dressing and toss to combine.
4. Serve on a plate or in bowls topped with the chow mein
   noodles, or better a mix of chow mein and toasted chopped almonds.

Serving size: 1.5 cups, serves 6.

I think due to the sauce, which has a generous amount of oil,
as well as the mandarins and chow mein,
we're looking at *400-600 calories per serving*.
