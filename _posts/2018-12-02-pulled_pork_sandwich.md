title: BBQ Pulled Pork Sandwiches
---

In the annals of recipes I made this year
I don't think there's one more hands-off recipe
than this BBQ pulled pork sandwich.

It's easy to make, delicious, and supports a fairly
large array of customizations. Furthermore,
it allows one to cook in advance a large amount
of pork which can then be used in other dishes.

I feel that a few warnings/caveats are important:

- the BBQ sauce is the king here and the bun is the queen;
  we were all in agreement that we couldn've substituted
  saw dust for the pork and still would've made a deliciuos
  sandwich; as such, make sure you select a BBQ sauce
  that you absolutely love;
- having a slow-cooker makes it the easiest variant possible;
  that being said, a Dutch oven would work too and would
  likely require a bit of monitoring;
- it's not easy to eat - as you bite into the sandwich,
  the pulled pork as the most liquid component,
  will have a tendency to escape the sandwich;
  most photos on the internet show a good inch of
  pulled pork between the buns - that's the ideal
  amount for taste and yet I found it totally unmanageable.

## Recipe

The typical pulled pork sandwich is made with
pork butt aka shoulder.

I used pork loin because it was on sale at Costco for
a little under $2/lb. I don't think it makes a difference -
the BBQ sauce annihilates whatever subtle flavor
the pork cut would've brought by itself (so select
a delicious BBQ sauce).

### Ingredients

- 1-2 lbs of pork butt, loin, shoulder, etc
  (*advice*: put as much as it comfortably fits
  into the slow cooker - freeze the remains)
- 1 cup of BBQ sauce - we used Sweet Baby Ray's
- bread: regular onion rolls work, so do scratch rolls,
  even Hawaiian rolls (if a paired with a not-so-sweet sauce)
- toppings: sauteed mushrooms, coleslaw, pickles are traditional
  
### Preparation

1. Place pork in slow cooker.
   Cook on low heat for about 5-6 hours;
   look for center temperature to achieve
   195F and for the pork to start coming
   apart when poked with a fork.
2. Pull pork apart, mix with whatever
   fat was in the pot.
   Add BBQ sauce and mix well.
3. Serve on buns with whatever toppings your
   heart desires.

Calories: hard to say because the type of BBQ sauce
and the bun make a large difference. All in all
I'd say 600-1,000 calories per serving, with some
30-50g of fat, around 40g of protein, and
way too many carbs. All worth it.
