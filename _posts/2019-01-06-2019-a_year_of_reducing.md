title: 2019 - A Year of Reducing
---

2019 was well on its way to be *A Year of Business* - I had some
plans about growing my business and getting more clients or
maybe explorer some passive income sources.

And then, towards the end of the year, I've read
Fumio Sasaki's *Goodbye, Things: The New Japanese Minimalism*,
which Apartment Therapy wonders if it's
[the New "Life Changing Magic of Tidying Up"][goodbye].

Burden by the expectations associated with various items
from my life (I've bought a guitar so I must learn to play),
I've been trying for a few years to work towards reducing
such objects from my life. *Goodbye, Things* gives a path,
a system for such reduction and that transformed 2019 into
*A Year of Reducing*.

In 2019 I am reducing:

- possessions;
- detrimental habits;
- reliance on a single big client for my income (and there in
  still looping some remnants of the former planned
  Year of Business).

The first one, **reducing possessions**, is pretty clear
and has a very precise goal behind it: I will get rid of
a minimum of 10 possessions per month. These may be something
as expensive as the guitar I mentioned, or it may be as cheap
as an empty container that's been pointlessly sitting on my desk
waiting for me to decide to do something with it.

The second one, **reducing detrimental habits** is a bit harder to nail
down as it requires a deeper introspection and also a commitment
beyond my normal abilities as some of these detrimental habits
are just coping means. To that extent, I will:

- reduce my consumption of alcohol or even give it up altogether
  (I probably sound like a heavy drinker and it's quite the opposite;
  I do have a penchant for sweet liqueurs and cocktails): no more than
  1 drink/week;
- paired with it, I will attempt to reduce snacking and
  stress-eating;
- spend less time playing video games: under 10 hours/week;
- spend less time on social media, mostly on Reddit (it's hard
  because I'm a compulsive information processor) - which
  I will reduce to the [/r/tldr](https://reddit.com/r/tldr)
  sub and perhaps a handful of meta-subs like business,
  programming, or minimalism related ones;
- spend fewer days and weekends indoors and more out enjoying
  the wonderful parks [my state offers](https://tpwd.texas.gov/state-parks/);

As for the third, **reducing single-client reliance**, all
I have is a vague goal -- $100/month in recurring revenue by/at the
mid-year point, $1,000/month by/at the end of the year -- and
a list of books:

- About the *process*:
  - The E-Myth Revisited
  - The Lean Startup
  - Four Steps to the Epiphany
- About the *mindset*:
  - Reword
  - Made to Stick
  - The Dip
  - Ego Is The Enemy
- About people in the space (biographies):
  - Shoe Dog
  - The Hard Things about Hard Things
- Misc:
  - Entreleadership
  - Build to Sell
  - The Goal
  - Rich Dad, Poor Dad
  - The Greatest Salesman in the World
  - 2019 Small Business Taxes
  - Psychology of Persuasion
  - 48 Laws of Power
  - Sell of Be Sold
  - The Slide Edge
  - The Pumpkin Plan
  - The Personal MBA

Seems quite a lot and I feel a bit overwhelmed, yet
most of them are things that take little time (except for reading books)
and a lot of discipline.

Ironically enough, a lot of my discipline in recent years comes
from playing video-games and seeing them through, being diligent
about working on multi-step quests or objectives.

Here's to hoping.
