title: January Report

One of the tips mentioned in [Goodbye, Things][goodbye]
was to leverage social media as a way of creating a personal pressure
to stay on track with the job of minimizing.

As such, I've [submitted a Reddit promise][ten] to get rid
of 10 things per month. There were a few encouraging comments and
one that led me to further analysis asking if this is about net
reduction or not.

I've emphatically committed to net items, meaning that if I had
acquired items during January, I would have to increase the number
of items I got rid of by the same amount - for example if I bought
1 item, I would have now to get rid of 11 items.

It was a decision I hesitated a bit as I didn't know what to expect
as far as purchases and at the end of the day commitment won.

As it turned out once I started out following the advice in the book
things ended up snowballing to the point where within a few days
I had over three times the amount I had committed to and had to
put a stop to it out of fear that I will discard everything in the
first month and thus not be able to keep my commitment
(habit building is important).

Some of the rules/tips that really helped:

1. *#9 - Start with things that are clearly junk* -
   examples of items I threw away: a dried out glue stick, pills, expired coupons;
2. *#11 - Get rid of it if you haven't used it in a year* -
   some clothing items and books fell under this category;
3. *#20 - Let go of the idea of someday* -
   this was hard one for me as I do love collecting projects;
4. *#14 - Take photos of the items that are tough to part with* -
   another difficult one as it seems that some gifts and hand-made
   items are just not made for getting rid of but for recollecting
   and maybe laughing about; I now have a folder of photos on my phone
   where I store this and you know what - it was actually
   easy to share and remember the item this way.

All that being said, January saw me acquire 2 items and discard 31,
a total net of 29.

On the business front I read/listened to 7 books,
not all of which apply at this point and all of which were
inspirational:

* Jason Schreier's "Blood, Sweat, and Pixels" (don't ever want to be
  in the video-game industry);
* Robert Kiyosaki's "Rich Dad, Poor Dad";
* "Outliers" by Malcolm Gladwell;
* "ReWork" by Jason Fried and DHH;
* Ben Horrowitz's "The Hard Thing About Hard Things";
* Chris Guillebeau's "The $100 Startup";
* currently reading Eric Ries's "The Lean Startup".
