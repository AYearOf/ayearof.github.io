[/r/fountainpens](https://reddit.com/r/fountainpens) is a guilty pleasure
and also a delightful curse, in that it creates occasional wants that go
against the path of minimalism I have set myself on.

In this case, spurred by the multiple beautiful posts of vintage fountain pens,
mostly Western (American and European), I felt it unjust that the much celebrated
East was not present more and when I happened upon a batch of vintage
Chinese pens, I couldn't resist.

That set me back 10 items in my desired to rid myself of net 10 possessions per month. Ouch.

Once again, one observation from [Goodbye, Things][goodbye],
that you have to just start and things happen from there on,
helped me reach a gross of 31 things I have gotten rid of,
whether it was donating -- the more valuable items -- or throwing
into the trashcan, for a net balance of 15 fewer possessions
once February reached its end.

I read fewer books this month than in January, although
none less valuable.
On the business front I read/listened to 7 books,
not all of which apply at this point and all of which were
inspirational:

* finished Eric Ries's "The Lean Startup", one book I wish
  I had read early in my twenties, because its concept of
  "validated learning" and its Build-Measure-Learn loop
  could be applied to almost any task in life where there is
  a progression possible, whether it's building a startup,
  a product, or even life's little things like dating,
  career, or getting ahead;
* Chip and Dan Heath's "Made To Stick", about what makes
  ideas and concepts sticky, introduced me to the [*SUCCESs*
  model][success]: Simple, Unexpected, Concrete, Credible,
  and Emotional Stories;
* Steve Blank's "Four Steps to the Epiphany" is the precursor
  to "The Lean Startup" methodology;
* Tim Feriss's "The Four Hour Work-week", even if a bit outdated,
  needs little introduction;
* Ryan Holiday's "Ego Is The Enemy" on the other hand feels like
  the modern-day's [stoic's handbook][stoicism].

March is happening tomorrow and it's my last chance to wrap up
the books that will help me pursue my goal of reducing
dependency on a single big client and give it shape in creating
a separate revenue stream that could provide me one day, soon I hope,
with the financial freedom that I so seek.
