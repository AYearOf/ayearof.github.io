title: March Update
---

March was a month of replacements and to a lesser degree of acquisitions
of items that I found truly useful, and to that the two rules that have
dominated the minimalism process have been:

- **Rule #13 - Differentiate between things you want and things you need**:
  seems like common sense advice and it *seems* generally easy to follow and
  yet very frequent I find myself enamored with how I imagine I *would* use
  something only to find myself not using it at all; the purchases that
  followed this rule have been items that solved a real problem in my life,
  *after* I discovered I had the problem and not before (example: a camping
  mattress after suffering through sleeping on some make-shift lounge pads);
- **Rule #46 - One in/One out**: for every new item you bring in your life,
  get rid of (at least) one; this replacement approach has
  allowed me to bring better items in my life and get rid of
  some items that were hanging around just because I used
  them every once in a while, but mostly avoided them
  due to various defects (e.g. scratched sunglasses, or some
  uncomfortable headphones).

In getting rid of a small number of cables I had lying around,
I also got to experience the [Concorde fallacy](https://dictionary.cambridge.org/us/dictionary/english/concorde-fallacy)
also known as [sunk cost fallacy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunk_cost)
as some of these items have been purchased because I had already
invested in an initial bigger purchase.

Overall, I got rid of 44 items and brought in some 15, for a net total
of -29, way over my 10 items threshold, and allow me to reflect
how many of my possession are no longer of use to me, just merely
hanging around for "just in case" and "what ifs".

On the business front, I wish I had more progress to report.  
I rationalized March as a month of reflection; while I did read
at least one book, [Raving Fans](https://www.amazon.com/Raving-Fans-Revolutionary-Approach-Customer/dp/0006530699/ref=tmm_pap_swatch_0?_encoding=UTF8&qid=&sr=) and found some value,
a good amount of time has been spent on just being unsure what direction
I can go in.

In the plus side, I have decided that I will read only one more area where
I lack knowledge before making a decision:
marketing, product validation and customer acquisition.

I am not as confident about having good books as I was in the previous months,
even more so given the subject is a lot more temporary. Management and startup
techniques change a lot slower than the mores and approaches of how
groups can be reach, sold to, and engaged.
