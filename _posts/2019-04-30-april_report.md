title: April Update
---

April ended up being a smaller month in more than one way:
count and size.

Net total was 17, which was over the 10/month, true,
and also on the lower side relative to the other months.

April was the month I "attacked" my box of computer cables
and ended up being mildly horrified about how many
out of date items it had: old PCI modems, RAM,
IDE cables, VGA cables, etc.

The [Goodbye, Things](https://www.amazon.com/Goodbye-Things-New-Japanese-Minimalism/dp/0393609030) tips
that resonated the most with me have been:

* "#10. Minimize anything you have in multiples" - I don't really
  need 4 SATA cables; one with straight connector and
  one with angled connectors is enough;
* "#11. Get rid of it if you haven't used it in a year" - some
  of these items I haven't used in *years* not in one year.
* "#17. Organizing is not minimizing" - I was really tempted
  and one point to just shuffled some items and add them
  to another box, just in case I'll need them in the future,
  however getting over it and actually getting rid of not
  only the contents, but the box they were in
  ("#18. Tackle the nest=storage, before the pest=clutter")
  helped ensure the items followed.

On the business side of the world, I decided
to look into [AWS Certifications](https://aws.amazon.com/certification/) as a way to both add skills
and obtain an edge over contractors and freelancers in a
similar position.  
First will be an AWS Solutions Architect - Associate,
followed by an AWS Developer - Associate, and after
that I plan on assessing whether DevOps - Associate
or another cloud (Azure?) certification is a better approach.

I guess time will tell whether this will have been an asset
or there would've been a better use of my time to
acquire different skills (sales? marketing? networking?),
but at this point it seems as a natural extension of my work
field.
