Doing this exercise, the ridding of things and controlling
the balance of in vs out, places a certain amount of emphasis
on the *in* and thus a mindfulness about acquiring items.

The overriding question about incoming items should be
"*do I need this?*", however, that might be a difficult
bar for someone getting into a minimalism and a minimalist life.  
Some people can jump off the deep end, some do better
starting at the shallow end and working towards
the final goal.

Perhaps a slower, and a more mindful way to think about it
is to looking at what purpose the new item serves:

* it might be replacing an older item that got used a lot ("one in, one out" rule);
* it might be a long want that can finally be met - maybe a new hobby;
* it might be a temporary situation, satisfying a
  temporary wish - after all, we're minimalists, not ascetics.

In all cases, though, it helps a lot if any new item
comes in with an exit strategy attached:

* maybe in replacing the old item, the new item will also
  be used to the end;
* same with the hobby - hopefully it will provide enjoyment
  and any purchases in this area are done mindfully
  rather than in a hoarding manner;
* for temporary items, it helps if the new item is bought
  with a vision towards re-selling it.
  
In both hobbies and temporary fancies,
there typically tend to be many models satisfying that goal,
so focusing on one that re-sells well and easily
makes possible to reconnect with the minimalist goal after this small detour.

For example, if one would like to get into playing guitar,
it's a far better idea to pick up a common brand
and in particular something at the entry-level
that would not cost a large amount (and risk making
it hard to part with it -- more about this in a bit):
start with an acoustic guitar and pick an entry-level Yamaha
over a Martin or a Taylor. If electric -- although
that means more purchases (amp, pedals) --
pick a, say, an Epiphone over a higher-end Gibson or a custom PRS.

That being said, the best option would be to borrow or rent
if possible, particularly for short-term endeavors,
to see if it's something that will stick or pass.

In [Goodbye, Things](https://www.amazon.com/Goodbye-Things-New-Japanese-Minimalism/dp/0393609030)
there are quite a good number of tips that address the inbound of items:

* **Tip 40: Be social, be a borrower** - and in borrowing an item
  you may also borrow the expertise or advice of the owner;
* **Tip 41: Rent what can be rented** - think or it as a trial
  and buy it if you use it often or for long;
* **Tip 49: Think of buying as renting** - buy with an eye
  towards reselling; if possible keep tags, boxes, original documentation.
* **Tip 47: Avoid the [Concorde fallacy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunk_cost)** -
  the snowballing of small purchases ancillary to a large purchase.  
  Very much seen in musical gear following an instrument purchase;
  lens, bags, and other photo gear following an initial camera purchase;
  etc.
* **Tip 24: Let go of the idea of getting your money's worth** and
  **Tip 30: Don't get hung up on the prices you originally paid** go
  hand in hand towards ridding of purchases without delay or
  unnecessary ruminations.

All in all, due to thinning the wardrobe following
good signals of what clothes have been worn or not,
as well as some creative selling of previously
purchased items, May saw a net total of -36 items,
my highest month so far.

Feels good.
