title: August Report
---

I just realized I missed the July report.
Looking back on my notes it seems to have been
a net positive of 15.

August isn't doing that well either with a minimum
of net 10 -- matching the promise, barely.

I good amount of reduction came from small items,
purchases that seem to make sense and they're cute
enough and useful enough to seem like they warrant
a place in one's life. Perfect examples: onion-shaped
food container to save ...partially used onions;
zucchini noodle maker -- used a few times and found
that we tend to purchase already made noodles
anyway; pineapple corer -- really easy to use,
for the most part and also leaving enough
behind that it requires further cuts with a knife.

Other items came, as usual from "maybe one day" projects
and free things being saved for no reason that the illusion
that they hold some value (even if I got them for free).  
Case in point: a pair of speaker stands I've had for years,
held because maybe one day I'll want to put some speakers
on them; a corded mouse that's been sitting so long
in the attic that the rubber parts on it had become
gooey.

It all made me reflect upon a tip from "Goodbye, Things":
*don't buy something because it's cheap; don't take
something just because it's free*. A large number of the
items I have gotten rid of are proof of this wisdom.
