title: September Report
---

September saw net total of 15 items,
coming from 19 items exiting and 4 entering.

Some of the 19 came from going through
the storage and finding out items that
were no longer in use, but still kept
around for that "just in case" event:
an alarm clock, an old phone stand,
a book that never got around to reading,
etc

Nine months in, it's amazing to see how
hone your senses become when it's identifying
items to get rid of; walking around to house
and they stand out as if they were glowing.
