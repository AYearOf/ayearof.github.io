title: October Report

October was an easy month thanks to
finally taking action on a large number
of decorations I had in the attic.

Having more of a functional incline,
I never placed much importance on decorations,
and only in so far as they fill in an empty
space that would've looked worse otherwise.

Furthermore, when moving, one tends to preserve the
decorations of the old place and try
to incorporated them at a new place.
When that doesn't work, they're usually
relegated to the attic.

This attic exploration helped not only
free space in the attic, but also helped
me net 20 items rid this month.
