title: November Report
---

There wasn't much interesting about
the net of November: 26 items out,
7 items in, for a net total of 19.

I am not looking forward to December.
My immediate and extended family don't
seem to comprehend the idea of not wanting
gifts for Xmas. It's also towards the end
of the month so it's almost as if I have
to get rid of more items in preparation
for what the year-end will bring.

Note to self: ask for experiences
rather than things. It still allows
people to feel good about gifting
while I don't have to deal with the
possession angle.

November is also the month
where I'm starting to think
about the next year so that
in December I can start planning
it a little better.

It's also month where the reflection
on the year past begins.

December is a busy month.
