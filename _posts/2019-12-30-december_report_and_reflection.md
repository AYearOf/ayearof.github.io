title: December Report and End-of-Year Reflection
---

A good part of the quest for ridding possession is controlling
the intake. December tends to be a challenge.

It seems that no matter how
insistent one is that they'd like to receive no gifts
some people have a hard time respecting that.
I don't fault them; it's tremendously difficult
to go against the tide, against all the societal
pressure that has long established that birthdays
and Christmases be celebrated primarily through two
means: food and gifts.

To be fair, I also didn't prepare properly. I should've
had this insight earlier on and provide a solution
that would meet both minimalist requirements as well as
the needs of the givers: ask for gifts of experiences
rather than ... things.

Examples of what I would consider experiences are,
generally speaking:

* entertainment tickets, be they to a movie, a concert,
  or a sporting event;
* culinary outings: a new cuisine, a new restaurant,
  or even an old haunt that hasn't been visited
  in a while;
* wellness experiences -- a massage or some sort
  of transient pampering like a spa day;
* things that get reasonably quickly exhausted;
  for example, a bottle of wine or perhaps
  a bottle of hot sauce;

With the latter point I would also include
certain "supplies", although they're a bit weird to gift,
when properly chosen they may be extremely
welcome even to a minimalist: a perfume,
make-up, a bottle of ink for someone
that's into fountain pens, or say drawing
paper or paints for an artist.

The final tally for December, taken even though there's
still a day left, puts me at: 17 items in, 28 items out,
for a total of -11.

Overall, I ended 2020 with 231 fewer possessions
than I started at the beginning of this journey,
twelve months ago.
[A promise kept][ten].

I also had some secondary goals:

* reduce my consumption of alcohol or even give it up altogether:
  *accomplished* - from a drink a week I think I reduced it
  down to a drink a month or so;
* attempt to reduce snacking and
  stress-eating - *accomplished*, although it waxed and waned
  throughout the year, overall it's been reduced and healthier
  items (fruits and veggies) swapped for more caloric intense
  delights;
* spend less time playing video games: under 10 hours/week:
  *kind of accomplished* -- overall reduced, but the release
  of Borderlands 3, a favorite series, put me back into
  north of 20 hours per week for a couple of months;
* spend less time on social media, mostly on Reddit:
  *failed*;
* spend fewer days and weekends indoors and more out enjoying
  the wonderful parks [my state offers](https://tpwd.texas.gov/state-parks/):
  *accomplished*, but not to the level I would've liked.

A tertiary goal has been to reduce the reliance on single-client
income and develop some alternately streams of income. Ultimately
this *failed*. Although it's something I intend to revisit
in the future, I have eventually come to accept that the
fastest path to [FIRE - Financial Independence/Retire Early][fire]
is to maximize my consulting income in order to achieve
a half-retirement or a [lean FIRE][lean] position
(*retire before 60 with less than $40k in planned yearly household expenses*),
which would be a good place from which to dedicate myself to
building these alternate income streams.

Looking back at it all, I'd say it's been a great year
and the things that worked to make it so have all
been underpinned by the [SMART][smart] goal system:

* Specific - reducing possessions, reducing consumption;
* Measurable - the [10 things a month challenge][ten];
* Attainable - much thanks to [Goodbye, Things](https://www.amazon.com/Goodbye-Things-New-Japanese-Minimalism/dp/0393609030)
  for providing a good template on how to;
* Realistic - 10 things per period seemed and was reasonable;
* Time-bound - monthly periods and one overall year.
