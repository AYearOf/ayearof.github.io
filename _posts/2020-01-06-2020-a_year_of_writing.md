title: 2020 - Year of Writing
---

To be perfectly honest, I think this is more of a venture
to tickle the vanity rather than to provide specific value.

I'm high on the [success of 2019]({% post_url 2019-12-30-december_report_and_reflection %}),
the *Year of Reducing*,
and feel like rewarding myself with a delusion.

I had originally started thinking that writing better
would be a great skill -- and it is -- but I realized
I was rationalizing. Sure, my text is not marketing or
copy quality; it's passable and functional. Sales skill
would serve a lot better.

It does however align with a long-concocted plan to [retire early][fire]
and if some modest income could be derived by writing,
something I always thought I loved doing,
then it'll be a strong pillar of those dreams.

It's delusional too given that most writer do no make a living
out of writing. I am armed with unrealistic hopes, though,
and a thesis that bringing an analytical approach to discovering
profitable niches will allow me to build this into a revenue stream

To that extent, a *Year of Writing* it is and its primary goal
is to become a published author. I use "author" over "writer"
because the goal is to be paid for my work.

**Goal #1**: make at least $100 during each of the last three months
of 2020 from published works.

**Goal #2**: to learn how to build a modest marketing and sales pipeline
that would support and enable goal #1.

To this extend, my plan for the year is as following:

* First quarter: research;
* Second quarter: write;
* Third quarter: refine and market;
* Fourth quarter: profit, of course, but also still write.

I think the following is a good detailed plan for the first quarter:

* January:
  1. read a couple of books on the craft of writing;
  2. create a nom-de-plume, an online persona for my writer
  as some of the writing venture might take me into territories
  I may not want connected to my other business ventures;
  3. begin research into literary niches that may be profitable
  and under-served; create a model or an approach on how
  to discover these niches;
  4. write at least one, likely terrible, short story on any subject;
     bonus: write two.

* February:
  1. refine market research and start reading works in those niches;
  2. continue reading books on the craft of writing. If possible,
     focus on either books applicable to those niches or books
     that could help in those niches;
  3. write two short stories closer to at least one of the categories
     researched; bonus: write four.

* March: at this point I expect (hope?) that research has pin-pointed
  one of more profitable niches and the effort will mostly towards
  serving those niches;

  1. continue reading material in the categories deemed most likely to
     be profitable;
  2. write a few (three or more) short stories in each of those categories
     (likely two or more categories);
  3. research self-publishing venues and eventually
     publish a subset of those stories online to gather some feedback
     -- hopefully somebody is willing to also read them.
