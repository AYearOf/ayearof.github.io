title: February Report
---

I have a bad habit of getting distracted with rabbit holes.
I see one and I feel a compulsion to go down it.
Sometimes it's like starting with a Wikipedia article
and many hours later I'm down only half of the starting
page but I have read 100 other pages linked from it.
Other times, it takes the shape of falling in love
with a technical solution when a half-assed manual
approached could have produced much of the same results
and often much shorter time. February was the later.

In trying to make progress on research topic,
I went down the road of trying to automate it.
Scrape down a certain site, parse the results,
extract the information using a Python scripts
and store various metrics into a database so that
I can build my data analysis on top of structured data.

The compulsion came from not being able to access
an inelegant solution an so I spent a good deal of time
trying to write not just useful code, but beautiful code too,
and trying to learn and practice new concepts while doing so.
While I have made good progress, I still don't have a
solution that allows me to proceed to the next step: data analysis
and trying to determine, perhaps mathematically,
a good niche.

Not all was wasted in February.

I have read several stories in a larger category
as one of the recommendations I picked up was to read
works in a potential category in order to become
familiar with the conventions of the genre.
It was eye opening and illuminating and I was happy
that the books I read on reading have helped me
better understand structure, characters, and settings.

I read only one "technical" book:
[Anne Lamott's *Bird by Bird*](https://amzn.to/38cW3iA).
I enjoyed it and captured many
great quotes and lessons from it. I think my favorite
and the most relevant to my endeavors:

> Almost all good writing begins with terrible first efforts.
> You need to start somewhere.
