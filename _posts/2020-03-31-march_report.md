title: March Report
---

I don't know what was about March that completely set me back to zero.
No writing. Nada. Barely any reading too save for  books because of
travel [Wildlife of the National Parks and Reserves of Costa Rica][crfogden]
by Michael and Patricia Fogden and
[Costa Rica - Culture Smart!: The Essential Guide to Customs & Culture][crkoutnik]
by Jane Koutnik.

(On the flip-side, I've discovered a really cool sunscreen:
[Blue Lizard](https://amzn.to/2wytAql). The bottles starts white
and they turn blue in the sun to indicate protection
needs to be applied.)

I could blame my lack of progress on any number of issues:

- travel/vacation - on one hand no more work, on the other hand
  exhaustion from activities and adventures;
- COVID-19, which provided constant anxiety; travel +  COVID-19
  proved a real worry machine;
- ramped up work to make up for vacation then catching up
  after vacation;
- uncertainty over the direction to pursue and seeming lack
  of "inspiration".

I need to meditate a bit on this and figure out exactly
what's holding me back. Perhaps it's a matter of time,
available time, but I feel there's a deeper reason
there. I need to find that deeper reason and work
with it or against it, whichever gets me move forward.
