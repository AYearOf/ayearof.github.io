title: Reflection on Year of Ones
---

A year of one giant failure and yet surprising progress.

Let's see how I tracked:

* One hundred pushups - ❌  
  Barely managed 25.
* One hundred squats - ❌  
  Could do 50, though.
* One pound lost a week - ❌❌  
  Gained over 20 instead.
* One meal a day (OMAD) - ❌  
  Tried, but I'm a stress eater and there was quite a bit of stress. For the largest part,
  I've been successful in sticking to OLMAD - one *large* meal a day.
* Eating out no more than Once a week - ✅  
  Finally something I managed.
* 10k steps at least three times a week - ❓  
  Increased to 7k a day and in the last 3 months managed to average
  about 10k/day.

And yet not a total failure, though I'm struggling to wrap my head around
the results.

The general theme of the year has been physical exercise. Body-weight.

I was doing pretty good, and then when I went back to the office I switched
to weightlifting 3 times/week, and 30-40 minutes of intense elliptical the other 2.

I started with baby-steps. Could barely bench-press or squat 50 lbs (on the bar).  
By the end of the year I was benching 110 lbs (+bar), squatting 140 lbs,
and dead-lifting 160 lbs. And yet, I couldn't do more than 25 push-ups, and
couldn't manage even a single pull-up.

The work-outs helped though. I used to get some pretty terrible mid-back pains
from poor posture. Every few months, like clockwork. In more than 6 months I
have been going to the gym I haven't experienced a single incident.  
That alone is a massive win as far as I'm concerned.
