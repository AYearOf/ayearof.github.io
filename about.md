A few years ago, in 2013 to be precise, 
[I](http://philipm.at/) have decided to give each year of my life 
a specific theme and I to spend my spare time 
that year pursuing that theme.

**2013** was supposed to be **a year of travel**. It was a flop.

**2014** was supposed to be **a year of adventure**. It was: 
every month I had an adventure, something I have not done before.  
Some were insane: [Rugged Maniac mud/obstacle run][rugged] in 40 degrees weather with 
crazy wind-chill; some were beautiful: sunrise on HaleakalƒÅ in Maui;
some were head-scratching fun: [Newport Pig Cooking Contest]; 
some were exhausting: [5150 Galveston Triathlon][gal5150]; 
either way, something new happened every month, though, 
perhaps like most adventures happen anyway, most were not 
planned.

From there on, I refined it and decided to have each year
be a generic theme with a more specific focus, and thus
**2015** was a [year of learning, with emphasis on music][2015].  

*Why* am I doing this? I honestly don't know, 
but it does seem to make my life both more interesting
and more grounded.
